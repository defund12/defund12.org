### Team organization

The teams and responsibilities/definitions are closely related to how issue(email) creation, review, and site additions happen. Please review team definitions on the [Teams README](TEAMS.md).

NOTE: All work that people are doing to further defund12.org is important and helpful. However in order to keep things moving efficently, we have defined teams and responsibilities so that we can move forward together in an efficent manner.

### Email templates

Please **review our [email template style guide](EMAIL_TEMPLATE_STYLE_GUIDE.md)**. All messages go through basic fact-checking and editorial review before they are published. Following the style guide makes this process go quicker!

NOTE: If possible, limit one email template per PR. This make it easier to process the history of whatâ€™s entering the codebase, and takes some strain off the reviewer.
