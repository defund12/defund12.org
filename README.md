## Contributions guidelines

### Email templates
* Please do not copy and paste emails from other locales. We are looking to crowdsource locale-specific data, voices, and perspectives. Think quality over quantity. If we wanted to implement a generic email template for any locale, we would have done it by now.
* In the email signature, please include [NAME], [EMAIL], [PHONE], [ADDRESS]. This information is super important, and avoids emails being filtered out by congress/council members!
* If possible, limit a PR to one email template. This make it easier to process the history of what's entering the codebase, and takes some strain off the reviewer.

Thank you so much!
