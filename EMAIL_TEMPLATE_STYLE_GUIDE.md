# Email template style guide

1. Email should include a salutation (e.g., “Dear X,”)
2. Emails should begin with “My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/BOROUGH/CITY].”
3. Emails should end with:\
[YOUR NAME]\
[YOUR ADDRESS]\
[YOUR EMAIL]\
[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
4. Emails should be first-person (e.g., “I demand…” not “We demand…”)
5. Remove hashtags
6. We are amplifying calls to defund the police, not reform them. The core message should be defunding the police. Specific demands for reforms (e.g., policing tactics and training) will be removed. If an email widely pulls in other issues or hones in on something very specific (e.g., funding being reallocated to a single, specific category rather than a more general array of social services), try to generalize. People using this tool can customize their emails to be more specific should they choose.
Sample language: “I urge you to advocate for a meaningful reallocation of the city's expenditures: away from policing, and towards social programs and resources that support housing, jobs, education, health care, child care, and other critical community needs.”
Avoid using police framing of community problems, i.e. “crime.” Instead of summarizing social programs as being more effective than policing at “reducing crime,” say that they are more effective at “promoting community safety.”
