Hi, thanks for your interest in adding your city to the website. 

Letters should follow our [letter style guidelines](https://github.com/defund12/defund12.org/blob/master/LETTER_TEMPLATE_STYLE_GUIDE.md). Please review this style guide, and ensure that APIs that we are using contain data for your locale.

Remember that messages must be specific to your locale and focused on defunding the police. If your message is copied from an external source, please provide a link to the original source.

Your request will be **closed** until you reply with the necessary content. Thank you!
