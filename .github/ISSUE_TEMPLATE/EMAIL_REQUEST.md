<!--
Hi, thanks for your interest in adding your city to the website. Emails on defund12.org are all written by community members. To add your city, you **must** provide:

- Email addresses (at least one) of the government officials you’d like to receive the message
- Detailed message concerning the budgeting decisions at stake in your community

**_Until you provide this content, we cannot post your city._**

Messages should follow our [email style guidelines](https://github.com/defund12/defund12.org/blob/gh-pages/EMAIL_TEMPLATE_STYLE_GUIDE.md). Remember that messages must be specific to your locale and focused on defunding the police. If your message is copied from an external source, please provide a link to the original source.

Your request will be **closed** until you reply with the necessary content. Thank you!
