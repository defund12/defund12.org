Hi, thanks for your interest in adding your city to the website. Emails on defund12.org are all written by community members. To add your city, you **must** provide:

- Subject line for the email
- Email addresses (at least one) of the government officials you’d like to receive the message
- Detailed message concerning the budgeting decisions at stake in your community

**_Until you provide this content, we cannot post your city._**

Follow our [email style guidelines](https://github.com/defund12/defund12.org/blob/gh-pages/EMAIL_TEMPLATE_STYLE_GUIDE.md) for quicker acceptance. If the email style guide isn't followed, your issue will be closed. We have a friendly robot that will delete any requests that do not at least include one instance of [NAME] or [YOUR NAME] in your letter!

Remember that messages must be city-specific and focused on defunding the police. If your message is copied from an external source, please provide a link to the original source.

Your request will be **closed** until you reply with the necessary content. Thank you!
