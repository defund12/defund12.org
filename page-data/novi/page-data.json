Recently, the country has begun to understand how pervasive systemic racism is and the role police brutality plays in contributing to this culture. I believe it is important that we do our best within our own community to identify ways to end these injustices.\n\nI am writing to demand that the Novi City Council adopt a budget that prioritizes community well-being, and redirects funding away from the police. Although the FY 2020-21 budget has been approved, I am asking for a reconsideration. The budget reflects a lack of concern in regard to social services from the government, such as education, healthcare access, and financial assistance. Investing in these areas will only strengthen our community and help promote equality amongst Novi’s residents. By reallocating funds, Novi can focus on having a culture that promotes diversity, by offering social services.\n\nBy looking at the FY 2020-21 City Budget, the Novi Police Department (NPD) is overwhelmingly represented. For one, about 55% of the Property Tax is directed to Public Safety. Only 14% is dedicated to Parks, Recreation, & Cultural Services and Community Development. Secondly, the General Fund allocates about $14 million to NPD, which is significantly greater than community and economic development [1].\n\nI demand that you take immediate action to ensure the following:\n* Reduce NPD’s allocation from the General Fund\n* Hire trained social workers to manage services such as mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence\n* Invest in community development initiatives, such as affordable housing, education, and youth services\n\nPlease assemble a city budget that meets the needs of all residents. The time is now to demilitarize the NPD and invest in social services.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n\n[1] https://www.cityofnovi.org/Government/City-Services/City-Manager/Budget-and-Multi-Year-Financial-Plan-(Current-and/Budget2020-2021Recommended.aspx","cc":null,"city":"Novi","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to City Council","state":"MI","permalink":"/novi","recipients":["bgatt@cityofnovi.org","dstaudt@cityofnovi.org","amutch@cityofnovi.org","lcasey@cityofnovi.org","kbreen@cityofnovi.org","hcrawford@cityofnovi.org","jfischer@cityofnovi.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
