I am writing to you as a constituent who is disturbed by the injustices and brutality carried out by police forces across the country, and particularly in the Phoenix PD. \n\nIn February, the council approved a community review board and Office of Accountability and Transparency. They were given the power to:\n\n- Investigate and provide independent reports on police use-of-force incidents and citizen complaints\n\n- Make disciplinary recommendations for individual officers to the Police chief\n\n- Recommend policy changes based on research and community feedback\n\nWhen the council approved the plan, it anticipated it would cost about $3 million, but in Wednesday’s 2020-21 budget decision it only received $400,000. In 2019, The Phoenix PD received $721 million from the City of Phoenix. The current City Manager recommendation is $741 million, a $20 million increase, yet they can’t provide $3 million to OAT. \n\nEnding police brutality should be a budget priority. Justice should be a budget priority. Health and safety--which are proven to be better promoted through social programs and education than policing--should be a priority. I demand that you, as a representative of your Phoenix constituents, fully fund OAT, and redirect a meaningful portion of the Phoenix PD budget to social services, cultural programs, and education, which are backbones of any healthy community. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[ADDRESS]\n[EMAIL]\n[PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Phoenix","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Phoenix Mayor and Council","state":"AZ","permalink":"/phoenix","recipients":["mayor.gallego@phoenix.gov","council.district.1@phoenix.gov","council.district.2@phoenix.gov","council.district.3@phoenix.gov","council.district.4@phoenix.gov","council.district.5@phoenix.gov","council.district.6@phoenix.gov","council.district.7@phoenix.gov","council.district.8@phoenix.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
