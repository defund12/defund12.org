I am writing to demand that the Santa Barbara City Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community wellbeing, and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nIn 2019, the City of Santa Barbara allocated 42 million dollars to our police system, an inordinate 32% of our total budget. This is compared to just $13 million allocated towards community development (9.2% of the budget). Within the community development budget, $1.05 million was projected to be spent on human services  (0.07% of the city's budget), with even less appropriated for housing development (0.04%).\n\nI demand that the City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Santa Barbara Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Santa Barbara residents.\n\nHistory has shown that police \"reform\" is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve--and in fact actively harms--our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Santa Barbara","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/santabarbara","recipients":["MHarmon@santabarbaraca.gov","KSneddon@santabarbaraca.gov","MJordan@santabarbaraca.gov","OGutierrez@santabarbaraca.gov","efriedman@santabarbaraca.gov","AlGutierrez@santabarbaraca.gov","cmurillo@santabarbaraca.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
