I am writing to urge Governor Raimondo, Mayor Grebien, and the members of the Pawtucket City Council to adopt a budget redirecting funding from the Pawtucket Police Department to initiatives that better serve the wellbeing of the community. It has become clear that police do not meet the needs of the community and are in fact a detriment to community safety, furthering the oppression of residents of color, undocumented residents, disabled residents, mentally ill residents, and LGBTQ residents.\n\nThe mayor’s office has proposed a police budget of over $24 million for FY21. This includes a significant sum to keep police in Pawtucket public schools, contributing to the criminalization of youth and the school-to-prison pipeline that disproportionately targets Black students and students of color within the Pawtucket Public School system.\n\nImagine what over $24 million could do for this community if it was invested in education, community mental health services, resources for formerly incarcerated, housing, and other services that have been proven to reduce crime and contribute to the safety and well-being of communities.\n\nPawtucket may be a small city in a tiny state, but we have shown that we can make a huge impact on America at large. We desperately need to change our financial priorities and let our tax dollars go to our community, not cops.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[ADDRESS]\n[PHONE NUMBER]\n[EMAIL ADDRESS]\n","cc":null,"city":"Pawtucket","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Governor, Mayor, and City Council","state":"RI","permalink":"/pawtucket","recipients":["governor@governor.ri.gov","don@dongrebien.com","dzelazo@pawtucketri.com","maraujo@pawtucketri.com","avitali@pawtucketri.com","evasquez@pawtucketri.com","pawtward1@gmail.com","MJWildenhain@pawtucketri.com","tmercer@pawtucketri.com","mkallman@pawtucketri.com","trudd@pawtucketri.com"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
