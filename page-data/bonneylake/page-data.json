As there has been increased light on police department and citizen interactions across the nation, I am concerned about our community's budget allocation for our police department in the current biennium. I demand there be an adjustment to the current budget and that future bienniums reflect the needs of our community through redistributing the funds given to the police department.\n\nLooking at the proposed budget for the 2020 year, our police department has received $8,240,428 in funding while our community events and community services allocation was collectively given a measly $85,032. This is concerning as it has been shown time and time again that other avenues such as social service organizations are more effective in addressing many of the issues police officers face in the field like homelessness, domestic violence, and substance use as examples.\n\nPolice historically stem from slave patrols. We cannot keep supporting an institution, a structure, to maintain white supremacy in our country and communities. I urge you to reflect the interests of your constituents. If we are going to be \"a center for diverse cultural and social opportunities,\" we need to act like one.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Bonney Lake","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"WA","permalink":"/bonneylake","recipients":["Mayor@cobl.us","vodopichj@cobl.us","harrisl@cobl.us","dolet@cobl.us","evansj@cobl.us","swatmand@cobl.us","mcclimansj@cobl.us","watsont@cobl.us","cartert@cobl.us","keithm@cobl.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
