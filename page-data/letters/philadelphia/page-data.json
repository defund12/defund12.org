I am writing you to demand the restructuring of the Philadelphia city budget in a way that prioritizes social services for communities and drastically minimizes spending on police. \n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing, embodied by the PPD's well documented history of disproportionately enacting violence against Black communities. We will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” We are demanding that our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.\n\nThe proposed $14 million budget increase for PPD is unacceptable and comes at the cost of affordable housing, support for essential city workers, and other transformative initiatives. These programs are needed now more than ever to alleviate the harms of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for Black and Brown communities. I ask that the mayor, city managing director, and city council members prove their love and dedication to the people of this city and reallocate funds to directly benefit those in need.","cc":null,"city":"Philadelphia","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and Council Members","state":"PA","permalink":"/letters/philadelphia","officials":["locality:legislatorUpperBody","locality:headOfState"]}},"siteConfig":{"letterPageHeader":"NOTE sending physical mail incurs a small fee of $1/letter.
