Many Malden residents have joined in this movement.\n\nReforming police departments does not work – that has been shown by many cities and states throughout the country for decades. Reforms have been attempted for decades – and yet there continues to be violence and violation of basic rights by police. Eric Garner was killed by chokehold by the NYPD in 2014 – over 10 years after the department banned chokeholds. Tamir Rice was murdered by Cleveland PD despite a requirement to warn and de-escalate before shooting. It is very clear that banning certain practices or requiring police to adhere to a continuum of force or de-escalation does not work. And yet Malden City devotes a great deal of the budget to the police every year, while financially starving essential services that help meet the basic needs of our community.\n\nDefunding the police is not radical – it is an essential and logical step towards supporting community services that truly help promote community safety. In Fiscal Year 2020, Malden is set to spend $11,592,266 on police \\[1\\]. This is more than the city is set to spend on the Health Department, Public Works and Public Facilities combined. We desperately need to fund services that support the community and cannot do so while supporting the truly excessive police budget in Malden. I ask that this committee make meaningful changes to the 2021 proposed budget to communicate that you prioritize this community’s concerns \\[2\\].\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]\n\n\\[1\\] https://www.cityofmalden.org/573/Fiscal-Year-2020-Proposed-Budget\n\\[2\\] https://www.cityofmalden.org/701/Fiscal-Year-2021-Proposed-Budget","cc":null,"city":"Malden","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor Christenson and City Council","state":"MA","permalink":"/malden","recipients":["mayor@cityofmalden.org","jsica@cityofmalden.org","citycouncil@cityofmalden.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
