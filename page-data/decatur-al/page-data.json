I am writing to demand that the City of Decatur adopt a budget that prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nThe police department had been allocated over $14 million last year, yet only $1,045,635 for community development and only $850,401 for youth services that could be used to bolster the community more efficiently than policing.\n\nFurthermore, the events that transpired on March 15, 2020, with business owner Kevin Penn are unacceptable. Mr. Penn called the police in a time of need because of a robbery in his shop and was then assaulted by the police himself when they responded to his call. I demand a thorough investigation and that police reports and other records related to the case, including the personnel files of the officer who punched Penn, and all unedited body camera video of the incident be released to the public.\n\nThis behavior did not stand up to the Decatur Police Core Values of having a servantâ€™s heart, being a problem-solver, or being compassionate. The officer who used this excessive use of force should be fired immediately, arrested, and charged with assault.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Decatur","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor Bowling and City Council","state":"AL","permalink":"/decatur-al","recipients":["tbowling@decatur-al.gov","wejackson@decatur-al.gov","khill@decatur-al.gov","pbibbee@decatur-al.gov","ckirby@decatur-al.gov","card@decatur-al.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
