Last April, NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio proposed major budget cuts for the Fiscal Year 2021, especially to education and youth programs, while refusing to slash the NYPD budget by any significant margin. \n\nI am emailing today to demand that you vote no on the Mayor's FY21 proposed budget. I appreciate the growing push from within city government for a $1 billion cut to the NYPD, but given the immense size of our police department, this doesn't go far enough. I urge you only to vote for a budget that includes at least 50% cuts to the NYPD budget and 50% cuts to the number of police officers, with full reallocation to social services and education programs. \n\nGovernor Cuomo has doubled the presence of the NYPD on New York City streets. I am asking that city officials lobby the same amount of attention and effort towards finding sustainable, longterm change. \n\nThank you, \n[YOUR NAME] \n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n","cc":null,"city":"New York","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Council Members","state":"NY","permalink":"/nyc","recipients":["mguerra@council.nyc.gov","District2@council.nyc.gov","SpeakerJohnson@council.nyc.gov","KPowers@council.nyc.gov","BKallos@BenKallos.com","Helen@HelenRosenthal.com","District7@council.nyc.gov","DAyala@council.nyc.gov","D09perkins@council.nyc.gov","yrodriguez@council.nyc.gov","District11@council.nyc.gov","Andy.King@council.nyc.gov","MGjonaj@council.nyc.gov","fcabrera@council.nyc.gov","Rtorres@council.nyc.gov","District16Bronx@council.nyc.gov","salamanca@council.nyc.gov","RDiaz@council.nyc.gov","district19@council.nyc.gov","pkoo@council.nyc.gov","FMoya@council.nyc.gov","BGrodenchik@council.nyc.gov","RLancman@council.nyc.gov","dromm@council.nyc.gov","JVanBramer@council.nyc.gov","Adams@council.nyc.gov","Koslowitz@council.nyc.gov","District30@council.nyc.gov","drichards@council.nyc.gov","eulrich@council.nyc.gov","slevin@council.nyc.gov","areynoso@council.nyc.gov","LCumbo@council.nyc.gov","district36@council.nyc.gov","info38@council.nyc.gov","lander@council.nyc.gov","meugene@council.nyc.gov","District41@council.nyc.gov","AskJB@council.nyc.gov","AskKalman@council.nyc.gov","District45@council.nyc.gov","AMaisel@council.nyc.gov","MTreyger@council.nyc.gov","cdeutsch@council.nyc.gov","DROSE@Council.nyc.gov","SMatteo@council.nyc.gov","borelli@council.nyc.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
