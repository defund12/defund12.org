I am writing to demand that funding is reallocated from SJPD to social and public programming that takes place in our communities. It is an outrage that 44% of city funding goes towards the Police Department. The SJPD has seen a rise in overtime pay which, more often than not, is paid out to officers responsible for harassing the unhoused, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color.\n\nWe demand that the City Council defund the SJPD. We join the calls of those across the country to defund the police. We demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk San Jose residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers police.\n\nIt is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the San Jose city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"San Jose","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and Council Members","state":"CA","permalink":"/sanjose","recipients":["mayoremail@sanjoseca.gov","District1@sanjoseca.gov","District2@sanjoseca.gov","District3@sanjoseca.gov","District4@sanjoseca.gov","District5@sanjoseca.gov","District6@sanjoseca.gov","District7@sanjoseca.gov","District8@sanjoseca.gov","District9@sanjoseca.gov","District10@sanjoseca.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
