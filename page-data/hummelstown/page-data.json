I am writing to you today to discuss defunding the Hummelstown Police Department.\n\nIn 2015, former Hummelstown Police Officer Lisa Mearkle fatally shot 59-year-old man David Kassik during a traffic stop and was acquitted of all charges. Even if the police department reached a settlement, that man will never get his life back. Furthermore, she tased and subdued him before shooting him in the back. De-escalation training and holding police officers accountable should be a priority along with defunding the Hummelstown Police Department.\n\nUpon review of the Hummelstown Borough website, there was no clear mention of how much of the budget was going toward the police department. This should be amended. For residents to be properly aware of where their money is going, there should be a clear budget delineated regularly. The Open Records and \"Right-to-Know Law\" on the website is not sufficient.\n\nInstead of increasing the police budget, it would be better for the community of Hummelstown if we invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Hummelstown","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Borough Administration","state":"PA","permalink":"/hummelstown","recipients":["borough@hummelstown.net","mokeefe@hummelstown.net","wryan@hummelstown.net","dhummer@hummelstown.net","dspittle@hummelstown.net"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
