The Approved Budget for FY 2020 states that $15,003,161 is allocated to the Sheriff, accounting for 81% of total public safety funds. Compared to the $9,416,204 allocated to all Health and Welfare services, this is enormously out of proportion with the needs and values of our community [1]. The Montgomery County Board of Supervisors should adopt a budget that prioritizes community well-being, and redirects funding away from the Sheriffâ€™s department. Additionally, given the likely budget shortfalls resulting from the pandemic, now is an urgent time to re-evaluate the priorities of our County.\n\nThe Montgomery County Board of Supervisors should begin meaningfully reallocating Sheriff Department funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community. We need funding for community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, schools and childcare, public health, sustainability, and infrastructure. Additionally, police officers should not be the first resource for every crisis. I demand a budget that reflects the needs and values of Montgomery County residents. We must take a hard look at the way the current system fails to serve-and in fact actively harms-our community, and come together to reimagine the role of law enforcement in our County.\n\nI am urging you to keep these things in mind for the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year and to invest in the people, not the police.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n\n[1] https://www.montgomerycountyva.gov/departments/finance-intro/budget","cc":null,"city":"Montgomery County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to the County Board of Supervisors","state":"VA","permalink":"/montgomerycounty","recipients":["bohnsr@montgomerycountyva.gov","blevinssm@montgomerycountyva.gov","fijalkowskisr@montgomerycountyva.gov","kingmt@montgomerycountyva.gov","shepparddo@montgomerycountyva.gov","biggsmw@montgomerycountyva.gov","demottsan@montgomerycountyva.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
