While I am glad to hear about Cook County passing a resolution to reduce police funding, I am writing to you today to demand the Cook County Board to set mandated deadlines and expectations for defunding the Cook County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAccording to the 2021 Cook County Preliminary Budget Forecast, the police departmentâ€™s budget is increasing to $75,308,817 from the 2020 approved and adopted $69,998,591. Police funding needs to instead be reduced and put towards programs like community development, COVID-19 care and economic relief, and education.\n\nThank you for your support in defunding the police, and I look forward to hearing about the action steps the Cook County Board plans on taking.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE]","cc":null,"city":"Cook County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to County Board","state":"IL","permalink":"/cookcounty","recipients":["cookcountyboard@cookcountyil.gov","Brandon.johnson@cookcountyil.gov","Dennis.Deer@cookcountyil.gov","bill.lowry@cookcountyil.gov","stanley.moore2@cookcountyil.gov","deborah.sims@cookcountyil.gov","donna.miller@cookcountyil.gov","alma.anaya@cookcountyil.gov","cookcty9@aol.com","luis.arroyojr@cookcountyil.gov","district10@cookcountyil.gov","john.daley@cookcountyil.gov","bridget.degnen@cookcountyil.gov","lsuffredin@aol.com","Scott.Britton@cookcountyil.gov","kevin.morrison@cookcountyil.gov","Frank.Aguilar@cookcountyil.gov","sean.morrison@cookcountyil.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
