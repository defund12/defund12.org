This is $401,758 more than in 2019 and is part of a trend of increasing police budgeting since at least 2010. The Avon Police Department has been increased a total of $1,756,764 since 2010. Additionally, the City of Rifle, Colorado, is budgeting $1,076,212 less for its police budget than Avon, despite Rifle's higher population. The Town of Avon's police spending is excessive and must be reallocated.\n\nI demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Avon residents. I call on you to meaningfully restrict the Avon Police Department budget and instead meaningfully reallocate funds towards social programs and resources that support health care, child care, education, affordable housing, and other critical community needs. We demand a budget that supports community well-being, rather than empowering the police forces that tear us apart.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Avon","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Town Council","state":"CO","permalink":"/avon","recipients":["jfancher@avon.org","shymes@avon.org","jwolf@avon.org","sprince@avon.org","aphillips@avon.org","cthuon@avon.org","tunderwood@avon.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
