I am writing to demand that the Tiburon City Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community well-being by redirecting funding away from the police and toward creating housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice and mental health workers to help the community.\n\nIn FY2017-2018, the City of Tiburon allocated an egregious $3,137,544 to our police department and have only increased this amount since then. Next year, there will likely be deficits as a result of the pandemic. The city should recoup these funds by decreasing the police budget.\n\nI demand that the City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Tiburon Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community. We need funding for community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, and affordable housing programs. Police officers should not need to be the first resource for every crisis. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Tiburon residents.\n\nHistory has shown that police “reform” is not enough. Policing in America was developed to protect the institution of slavery. More money and training programs will not only not fix our current system, they will cause future lives to be lost to police brutality. We must take a hard look at the way the current system in place fails to serve-and in fact actively harms-our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.\n\nI am urging you to keep these things in mind for the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year and to invest in the people, not the police.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Tiburon","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/tiburon","recipients":["town@townoftiburon.org","afredericks@townoftiburon.org","hollithiertiburontowncouncil@gmail.com","dkulik@townoftiburon.org","jryan@townoftiburon.org","jwelner@townoftiburon.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
