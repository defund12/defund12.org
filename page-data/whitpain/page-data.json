I am writing to demand that the Whitpain Township Board of Supervisors implement a new budget that prioritizes our community's well-being and redirects funding away from police.\n\nThe 2020 Whitpain Township budget proposal presentation indicated that the General Fund allocated $7.49 million to Police, making up 47% of the $15.9 million in total expenditures. This is an inordinate amount of funding, compared to the amount of funding that Public Works & Facilities ($3.8 million) and Parks & Recreation ($800,000) received.\n\nI demand that the township reallocate this funding to more meaningful community projects, such as community-based mental health services, affordable housing programs, and substance abuse treatment. Our budget ought to reflect the needs of our community.\n\nWe have witnessed the glaring inadequacy of police departments across our country to truly serve and protect. Simple reforms are not enough to reduce police violence. We have the ability to reshape our communities, and that starts with rethinking the role of police.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Whitpain Township","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to the Board of Supervisors","state":"PA","permalink":"/whitpain","recipients":["supervisors@whitpaintownship.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
