I am asking you to reallocate money away from the Nassau County PD, which disproportionately targets Black residents. From traffic stops, to arrests, to the use of lethal force, Nassau PD targets nonwhite residents at a rate far exceeding their share of the population. Much scholarship shows that a living wage, access to health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at promoting community safety than policing and prisons. As such, I demand a meaningful reallocation of PD funds towards healthcare and social programs. \n\nSincerely, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n","cc":null,"city":"Nassau County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to County Legislature","state":"NY","permalink":"/nassau","recipients":["rnicolello@nassaucountyny.gov","hkopel@nassaucountyny.gov","kabrahams@nassaucountyny.gov","csolages@nassaucountyny.gov","vmuscarella@nassaucountyny.gov","adrucker@nassaucountyny.gov","rmwalker@nassaucountyny.gov","dford@nassaucountyny.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
