This is almost a 6% increase within one year. That money could be better spent on supporting affordable housing, educational opportunities, healthcare, and community outreach programs that are more successful at promoting safe and stable communities than law enforcement. I demand more aggressive financial support be directed to those areas.\n\nI am demanding long term and sustainable change. I am demanding that the city of Columbiaâ€™s budget be better spent on quality of life for all. In particular for those in our Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities, who are more likely to be directly affected by police brutality and violence. I also urge the Columbia City Council to enact legislation that holds police accountable and to overturn policies that allow police to engage in unlawful behavior with impunity.\n\nPeople are marching in the streets because they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to please listen to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action to address their concerns. Can I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social service programs?\n\nThank you,\n\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]","cc":null,"city":"Columbia","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor Benjamin and City Council","state":"SC","permalink":"/columbia","recipients":["skbenjamin@columbiasc.net","shalaine.archie@columbiasc.gov","sam.davis@columbiasc.gov","tidevine@jilawfirm.com","Howard.Duvall@columbiasc.gov","Edward.McDowell@columbiasc.gov","djrickenmann@Columbiasc.gov","Will.Brennan@columbiasc.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
