I am writing to demand that the Ridgefield Board of Selectmen adopt a city budget that prioritizes community wellbeing, and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nIn 2019, Ridgefield recorded a $5,495,911 expenditure on Police compared to a $232,140 expenditure on social services.\n\nI ask that the town begins to meaningfully defund the Ridgefield Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more.\n\nHistory has shown that police \"reform\" is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve--and in fact, actively harms--our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our town.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Ridgefield","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to the Boards of Finance and Selectmen","state":"CT","permalink":"/ridgefield","recipients":["selectman@ridgefieldct.org","Bob@HebertPartners.com","controller@ridgefieldct.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
