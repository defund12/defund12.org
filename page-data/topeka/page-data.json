I am writing to demand that the Topeka City Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community well-being, and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nAs you know, in the 2019 budget, the City of Topeka allocated an increase of over $4 million to fund the Topeka Police Department. In the 2020 budget, the City of Topeka increased the Police Department budget another $700 thousand. The TPD budget equates to an inordinate 42.43% of our taxpayers contributions to the city’s general fund, at over $40 million [1].\n\nI demand that the City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Topeka Police Department and reallocating those funds to programs which effectively promote a safe and equitable community, such as the YWCA Center for Safety and Empowerment and Community Action. We need funding for community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, and affordable housing programs, not police.\n\nHistory has shown that police “reform” is not enough. The 2020 Topeka City Budget includes a desire to promote public safety and to shift public perception of health/safety in Topeka; this cannot be done through police 'reform' alone. We must take a hard look at the way the current system in place fails to serve—and in fact actively harms—our community and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.\n\nI am urging you to completely revise the current budget as well as the 2021 budget, and to invest our taxpayer money for the people, not the police. As an elected official, I trust that you will do the right thing for the community that elected you. This is a moment for you to step up and show that you care for our community.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[ADDRESS]\n[EMAIL]\n[PHONE ]\n\n[1] https://cot-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/finance/Budget/2020+Adopted+Budget+Book.pdf","cc":null,"city":"Topeka","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to the Mayor, City Council, and City Manager","state":"KS","permalink":"/topeka","recipients":["btrout@topeka.org","khiller@topeka.org","cvaldivia-alcala@topeka.org","sortiz@topeka.org","temerson@topeka.org","mpadilla@topeka.org","hnaeger@topeka.org","ndobler@topeka.org","sduncan@topeka.org","mlesser@topeka.org","council@topeka.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
