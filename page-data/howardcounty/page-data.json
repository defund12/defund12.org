I am writing to demand the Howard County Council adopt a city budget that redirects funding away from the police to more community-oriented forms of public safety and wellbeing.\n\nFor 2020, Howard County has allocated $127 million to the police, which is a staggering amount of money [1]. Though the county has succeeded in prioritizing community enrichment, with an astounding 57.51% of the general budget directed toward education, the current distribution of funds fails to adequately meet the needs of community members [1]. In recent years, the county has witnessed a significant rise in opioid overdoses. Yet, departments intended to promote community wellness including Community Services and the Health Department only receive 6% and 1% of the budget, respectively [1].\n\nI demand that the County Council move to defund the Howard County Police Department and redirect them towards programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: mental health services, drug rehabilitation services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that prioritizes nonviolent, community-based approaches to public health and safety.\nHoward County needs to continue building a community that fosters health and wellness, we must reimagine a form of public safety that favors prevention and rehabilitation over punishment.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n\n[1] https://www.howardcountymd.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=4c-Hls1c5e4%3d&tabid=1111&portalid=0","cc":null,"city":"Howard County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to County Officials","state":"MD","permalink":"/howardcounty","recipients":["cball@howardcountymd.gov","ewalsh@howardcountymd.gov","ojones@howardcountymd.gov","crigby@howardcountymd.gov","djung@howardcountymd.gov","dyungmann@howardcountymd.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
