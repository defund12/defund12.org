That has increased $700,000 in the past 6 years while other services have been cut or kept the same. That's about 25% of our total budget for a town of roughly 15K people, taking away desperately needed resources from essential city programs and services.\n\nI demand that the Mayor and City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Beacon Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: our public schools and after-school programs, a recreation center, emergency health center, community-based mental health services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Beacon residents.\n\nHistory has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.\n\nThank you for your time, \n[YOUR NAME] \n[YOUR ADDRESS] \n[YOUR EMAIL] \n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Beacon","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"NY","permalink":"/beacon","recipients":["tnelson@cityofbeacon.org","arhodes@cityofbeacon.org","jmccredo@cityofbeacon.org","daymarblair@cityofbeacon.org","gmansfield@cityofbeacon.org","agrant@cityofbeacon.org","mayor@cityofbeacon.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
