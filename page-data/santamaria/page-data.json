I am writing to demand that the Santa Maria City Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community wellbeing, and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nIn 2019, the City of Santa Maria allocated 34 million dollars to our police system, an inordinate 42.5% of our total budget. This is compared to just $4 million allocated towards community development (5.0% of the budget). Within the community development budget, only $1.2 million was projected to be spent on CDBG & HOME Programs (3.5% of the city’s budget).\n\nI demand that the City Council begin defunding the Santa Maria Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Santa Maria residents.\n\nHistory has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]","cc":null,"city":"Santa Maria","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/santamaria","recipients":["CityCouncil@cityofsantamaria.org","apatino@cityofsantamaria.org","gsoto@cityofsantamaria.org","ewaterfield@cityofsantamaria.org","mmoats@cityofsantamaria.org","mcordero@cityofsantamaria.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
