The time for election is near, and the time for action is now. During the rest of your term, I urge you to take a stand and commit to divesting from our dependency on law enforcement.\n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing embodied by the LAPDâ€™s well documented history of murdering Black people. As a part of greater LA county, now is a critical time to assert our city's commitment to justice.\n\nAccording to the FY2018-2019 budget (the most recent budget publicly available online), nearly half of Artesia's budget is allocated to Law Enforcement (41%). In comparison, Parks & Rec receives 9%, Maintenance and Public Works receives 7%, Building and Safety receives 3%, and Community Promotions receives only 2%.\n\nAs your constituent, I urge you to:\n\n* Decrease funding for Law Enforcement so that our community investments significantly outweigh our law enforcement investment.\n\n* Issue a statement in support of defending Black lives.\n\n* Issue a statement committed to divesting in law enforcement and investing those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community.\n\nThe public opinion is with me.\nThank you.\n\nYour constituent,\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]","cc":null,"city":"Artesia","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, City Manager, and City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/artesia","recipients":["tlima@cityofartesia.us","mcanales@cityofartesia.us","ataj@cityofartesia.us","rtrevino@cityofartesia.us","mramoso@cityofartesia.us","jalderete@cityofartesia.us","wrawlings@cityofartesia.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
