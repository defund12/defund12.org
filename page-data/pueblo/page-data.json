You must support a budget that supports social equity in our community, rather than empowering the police forces that tear us apart.\n\nIt is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to advocate for revision of the Pueblo city budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year to reflect the decades of research showing that education and social programs better promote the safety of a city than policing.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Pueblo","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"CO","permalink":"/pueblo","recipients":["mayor@pueblo.us","cityadmin@pueblo.us","bobschilling68@gmail.com","latencio@pueblo.us","ebrown@pueblo.us","raguilera@pueblo.us","maliff@pueblo.us","dflores@pueblo.us","lovepueblo@yahoo.com","policedept@pueblo.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
