I am writing to demand that the Plano City Council adopt a budget that prioritizes community well-being, and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nIn the most recent city budget, a staggering $78 million was allocated to the Plano police department [1]. It is undeniable that the expanding use of incarceration in Texas disproportionately affects the state’s nonwhite citizens. The current city budget signals that law enforcement is almost 17 times more important than community outreach, and I do not believe that this aligns with this council's values.\n\nI demand that we reallocate funds from the police department to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community and to address economic disparities. These programs could include community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. We need a budget that reflects the actual needs of Plano residents.\n\nHistory has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city. I strongly urge you to remove funding from police departments and reallocate it to social services that make a meaningful difference for the citizens of Plano.\n\nSincerely, \n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR PHONE]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n\n[1] https://www.plano.gov/DocumentCenter/View/40521/2019-20-Program-of-Service","cc":null,"city":"Plano","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"TX","permalink":"/plano","recipients":["citycouncil@plano.gov","mayor@plano.gov","kayciprince@plano.gov","aricciardelli@plano.gov","mariatu@plano.gov","rickgrady@plano.gov","shelbywilliams@plano.gov","ricksmith@plano.gov","lilybao@plano.gov","deedee@plano.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
