I am writing to you all in regards to the current budget that has been allocated to the Police Department. As a community we need to redistribute these funds to other services that are more appropriate in addressing the issues the Police Department faces.\n\nIn the adopted 2020 budget, 42% of the general fund is being allocated to the Police Department to assure a high level of public safety. However, by utilizing funding in this way, the needs of the residents of Puyallup are failing to be met. Failing to meet these needs influence public safety. These needs can be met through increased funding to libraries, parks and recreation, the programs in our community such as the Puyallup Food Bank, Rebuilding Hope!, and Helping Hand House as examples. Utilizing this route would align with Puyallup's City Council Priorities: \"Effectively manage expenditures, while seeking to increase traditional revenue sources and pursue alternative sources,\" \"Evaluate programs, regulations, and practices to provide a high level of service to the community,\" and \"Actively promote Puyallup's economic development and redevelopment opportunities while maintaining the essence and character of our community.\" Funding could also be redistributed to the capital funds.\n\nAs representatives of your community, I am encouraging you to revise your budget for the 2020 fiscal year to better serve the needs of Puyallup. Consider the trends in our own U.S. history and what research has shown to work best in comparison to the police in some of the problems our community faces.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Puyallup","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"WA","permalink":"/puyallup","recipients":["jdoor@ci.puyallup.wa.us","jpalmer@ci.puyallup.wa.us","rfarris@ci.puyallup.wa.us","jkastama@ci.puyallup.wa.us","cjacobsen@ci.puyallup.wa.us","nwitting@ci.puyallup.wa.us","djohnson@ci.puyallup.wa.us","mwinter@ci.puyallup.wa.us","skirkelie@ci.puyallup.wa.us","jmjohnson@ci.puyallup.wa.us","mneal@ci.puyallup.wa.us","brenda@ci.puyallup.wa.us","eunruh@ci.puyallup.wa.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
