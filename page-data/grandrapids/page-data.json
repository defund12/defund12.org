I am writing to ask that you to call an emergency council meeting and challenge the mayor’s proposed budget before it is adopted on July 1st, in favor of a budget for the people. \n\nI know that public services are set to be cut by $22M by FY2021. I think that this is unacceptable, and ask that funds be redirected away from the Grand Rapids Police Department and into public services such as affordable housing, education, and healthcare access, and to consider direct financial relief to citizens, not just businesses, impacted by COVID-19. \n\nThis funding must be redistributed based on the input of community groups and leaders so that it provides the most relief to communities of color that have historically been over-policed and\ndisinvested in due to the structural racism and inequity that Grand Rapids is built upon, and that the Grand Rapids Police Department and City are\ncomplicit in enforcing. Public tensions are rising and public opinion is dwindling in regard to the City’s inappropriate response to the murder of George Floyd and militarized, over-policed response to subsequent protests of police brutality and racism.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n","cc":null,"city":"Grand Rapids","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to the Mayor, Comptroller, and Ward Commissioners","state":"MI","permalink":"/grandrapids","recipients":["mayor@grcity.us","comptroller@grcity.us","joconnor@grcity.us","kreppart@grcity.us","jdjones@grcity.us","mysasi@grcity.us","slenear@grcity.us","nmoody@grcity.us","manager@grcity.us","cityatty@grcity.us","meastman@grcity.us","asnow@grcity.us","communitydev@grcity.us","inclusion@grcity.us","RachelHood@house.mi.gov","DavidLaGrand@house.mi.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
