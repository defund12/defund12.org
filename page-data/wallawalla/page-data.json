As a country, we are demanding that our voices be heard and that real change be implemented at all levels of community and government.\n\nWalla Walla must follow the example set by cities like Minneapolis and respond to police violence by reevaluating our city’s budget priorities to better reflect the needs of our community. I urge you to advocate for a meaningful reallocation of the city’s expenditures: away from policing, and towards social programs and resources that support housing, education, physical healthcare, mental healthcare, childcare, and other critical community needs while responding to issues like domestic violence and sexual assault with trained crisis responders. Research shows that a living wage, access to health services and treatments, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at reducing crime than police or prisons \\[1\\].\n\nThe 2020 budget for policing in Walla Walla currently exceeds $9.98 million USD, accounting for 27.5% of the city’s general fund expenditure \\[2\\]. Applied elsewhere, this money could effect real, positive change in our community. I demand the immediate freezing of budget increases to the WWPD, demilitarization of the police force, and reallocation of funds from police to community-led health and safety strategies. This must be a priority for not just the 2021-2022 biennial budget, but all subsequent city budgets.\n\nIf we have the courage to change, we can set a positive example for all of Eastern Washington.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\\[YOUR FULL NAME\\]\n\\[HOME ADDRESS\\]\n\\[EMAIL ADDRESS\\]\n\\[TELEPHONE\\]\n\n\\[1\\] https://populardemocracy.org/news/publications/freedom-thrive-reimagining-safety-security-our-communities\n\\[2\\] https://www.wallawallawa.gov/home/showdocument?id=2903","cc":null,"city":"Walla Walla","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor Scribner and City Council","state":"WA","permalink":"/wallawalla","recipients":["tscribner@wallawallawa.gov","smoss@wallawallawa.gov","ybahena@wallawallawa.gov","rclubb@wallawallawa.gov","mhuie@wallawallawa.gov","tkoehler@wallawallawa.gov","snakonieczny@wallawallawa.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
