This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-Blackness, and immediate reform in how Black people are treated in America. Our city has a shameful history of police abuses and murders. We are 3rd in the state per capita for police murders, and our city police have one of the highest salaries and benefits packages in the state. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for 2021 is being decided as these protests continue.\n\nVPD has been a massive waste of our resources. Vallejo has been in the news several times over the last two years alone for acts of excessive force and murder by the police. As of June 13th last year, the city had 35 pending claims and lawsuits in connection with the Vallejo Police Department, 16 of which allege excessive force. We have one of the highest amounts of lawsuit payouts in the Bay Area, having paid out more than $7 million in civil rights lawsuit settlements involving our police department since 2011. This year, the VPD budget is approximately 22% of available city-wide spending. While we’ve been spending extraordinary amounts on policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our city. Instead, we see wasteful and harmful actions of our police.\n\nI call on you to slash the VPD budget and instead use those resources specifically towards solving homelessness, which is felt most by our Black neighbors and veterans. We implore you to give every member of our community experiencing homelessness a place to call home and the treatment they need.\n\nWe can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\nThank you!!","cc":null,"city":"Vallejo","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Elected Officials","state":"CA","permalink":"/vallejo-ca","recipients":["michelle.straub@cityofvallejo.net","Bob.Sampayan@cityofvallejo.net","Hermie.Sunga@cityofvallejo.net","hakeem.brown@cityofvallejo.net","Pippin.Dew@cityofvallejo.net","Robert.McConnell@cityofvallejo.net","Katy.Miessner@cityofvallejo.net","Rozzana.Verder-Aliga@cityofvallejo.net","ehannigan@solanocounty.com","mebrown@solanocounty.com"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
