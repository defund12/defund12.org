The funding for police increased 6% this year while spending was decreased for community services by 3%, engineering by 45%, fire by 28%, public works by 11%, and water by 25%. In actuality, Victorville spent over $29.1 million renewing the contract with San Bernardino County Sheriffâ€™s Department. The new contract granted 3% wage increases to employees for five years, beginning in August 2019; while those with prior experience trained in law enforcement were given an additional 1% increase for four years, starting January 2021.\n\nThe investment in policing has not made us safer. The police remain a lethal threat to Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities, while increased police spending shows no correlation to decreasing \"crime\" levels over the past 20 years. With current finances already strained and other vital departments suffering, it is clear that we must defund the police. The city needs to prioritize infrastructure, community services, and mental health to properly serve the community's needs. Rather than spending $450,000 on technology in an attempt to help catch people running red lights, the budget could be spent on projects that lead to job creation or helping Victorville's ever-growing community of people experiencing houselessness.\n\nAs a Victorville resident, I demand that you take immediate action to ensure the following:\n\n* Adopt a budget for the people that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police.\n\n* Drastically reduce Victorville Police's allocation from the General Fund.\n\n* Disallow unauthorized overtime.\n\n* Discontinue use of general fund dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence.\n\n* Invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers, which are all more effective at promoting community safety.\n\nVictorville cannot wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to defund Victorville Police and end the city's contract with the San Bernardino's County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThank you,\n\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]","cc":null,"city":"Victorville","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor Garcia and City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/victorville","recipients":["ggarcia@victorvilleca.gov","rramirezdean@victorvilleca.gov","jcox@victorvilleca.gov","bagomez@victorvilleca.gov","dsjones@victorvilleca.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
