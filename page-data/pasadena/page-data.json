I am writing to demand that the City Council adopt a budget that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nNot only are we experiencing the trauma of global pandemic, we are also in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence embodied by American police departments’ well-documented history of murdering Black people. Empty gestures and suggestions of “reform” are unacceptable. I am demanding that the City Council of Pasadena stand with the People. I am demanding that you root out systemic and institutional racism by defunding the police and prioritizing and reallocating much-needed funds to education, housing, and community and social services.\n\n* Reallocate PPD's $91 million dollar budget towards a neglected public school system, social programs for youth/young adults, public health and housing services, etc.\n* Work in partnership with the City Council to develop a reparations ordinance as cities like Chicago have established. This policy would provide financial, mental health, educational and other resources for the families of victims of police torture.\n\nI also entreat you to stand in solidarity with the movement by demanding change from the LAPD. As neighbors, we are duty-bound to hold each other accountable. I join the calls of those across the country to meaningfully defund the police. The people are demanding a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowering the police forces that tear them apart.\n\nYou need to adopt a budget that prioritizes the social programs proven to promote safety and equity much more effectively than policing. You need to steadfastly pressure your peers on the City Council to do the same. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOURNAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Pasadena","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/pasadena","recipients":["ttornek@cityofpasadena.net","district1@cityofpasadena.net","mmcaustin@cityofpasadena.net","jkennedy@cityofpasadena.net","gmasuda@cityofpasadena.net","vgordo@cityofpasadena.net","smadison@cityofpasadena.net","awilson@cityofpasadena.net"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
