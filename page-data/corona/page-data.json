I am emailing you today to demand that you vote no on the FY21 proposed budget. Furthermore, I urge you to pressure the office of the mayor towards an ethical and equal reallocation of the Corona general expenditure budgets away from the CPD and towards educational programs, social services, and community development programs effective at the beginning of FY21.\n\nThe cityâ€™s proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2021 increases the CPD budget by over $2M, reinforcing a historically disproportionate allocation of funds towards this department (32.86% of the general fund went towards the CPD in FY2020). Also, the proposed budgets for Community Development, Public Works, and Library & Recreation are either cut or marginally increased.\n\nThe proposed CPD budget for FY21 is larger than Community Development, Library & Recreation, and Public Works combined. I am asking that city officials strategically reallocate funds and responsibility away from police and towards community-based models of safety, support, and prevention.\n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Corona","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/corona","recipients":["Jim.Steiner@CoronaCA.gov","Jacque.Casillas@CoronaCA.gov","Yolanda.Carrillo@CoronaCA.gov","Jason.Scott@CoronaCA.gov","Wes.Speake@CoronaCA.gov","Chad.Willardson@CoronaCA.gov","CityClerk@CoronaCA.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
