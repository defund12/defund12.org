I demand that the budget vote be delayed so that the Council may find ways to redirect money away from Madison Police Department’s overinflated budget. I urge you to pressure the City Manager’s Office towards an ethical and equal reallocation of the city’s expenditures, away from MPD, and towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and class inequality. \n\nResearch shows that a living wage, access to holistic health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at reducing crime than police or prisons. As such, I demand more aggressive financial support be directed to those areas.\n\nI also urge the Madison Common Council to enact legislation that holds police accountable and to overturn policies that allow police to engage in unlawful behavior with impunity. These \nsteps to reform the police department are also necessary now but true justice will only occur when the police are defunded. \n\nPeople are marching in the streets because they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to please listen to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action to address their concerns.\n\nCan I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social service programs?\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Madison","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Council Members","state":"WI","permalink":"/madison","recipients":["district1@cityofmadison.com","district2@cityofmadison.com","district3@cityofmadison.com","district4@cityofmadison.com","district5@cityofmadison.com","district6@cityofmadison.com","district7@cityofmadison.com","district8@cityofmadison.com","district9@cityofmadison.com","district10@cityofmadison.com","district11@cityofmadison.com","district12@cityofmadison.com","district13@cityofmadison.com","district14@cityofmadison.com","district15@cityofmadison.com","district16@cityofmadison.com","district17@cityofmadison.com","district18@cityofmadison.com","district19@cityofmadison.com","district20@cityofmadison.com"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
