Petty and Members of the Worcester City Council,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of Worcester, MA. In light of the events that have occurred including but not limited to the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor I demand to see the reduction of funding for the Worcester Police Department. Rather than invest in a system that has been founded on racist principles and that has perpetuated the unnecessary deaths of so many Black people nation wide, I suggest we reallocate money towards building up and supporting the Black and Brown communities that make Worcester the city it is.\n\nThe 2020 fiscal budget allocated over $52 million to the Worcester Police Department, more than the budget for Health and Human Services, Human Resources, and Public Works and Parks combined. I believe that this money could be have a greater use being invested in education, healthcare, and countless other social programs at the benefit of Worcester's Black and Brown communities. The City Council must take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing.\n\nRacist police violence doesnâ€™t just happen in other cities - it happens here in Worcester too. However, with action we can create change. The City Council must stop investing so large sums of money into a system created to perpetuate racism and discrimination and fund what Black and Brown communities need to be safe and healthy: COVID19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, healing, cooperative businesses, community centers, community-led organizations and projects.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Worcester","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor Petty and City Council","state":"MA","permalink":"/worcester","recipients":["mayor@worcesterma.gov","BergmanM@worcesterma.gov","ColorioD@worcesterma.gov","KingK@worcesterma.gov","RosenG@worcesterma.gov","ToomeyK@worcesterma.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
