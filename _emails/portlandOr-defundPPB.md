subject: Defunding the PPB & Increasing PPB Transparency
body: "I am a resident of [YOUR CITY/DISTRICT]. \n\nIn early May, Mayor Ted Wheeler released 
his proposed budget for the City of Portland. This included a policing budget of $236,991,195, 
which is over $10 million more than last year! The Portland Police Bureau (PPB), with Wheeler 
at its helm as Commissioner, has been mired in controversy over the last year with collusion with 
prominent white nationalist groups, shootings of Black people and people perceived to be in mental 
health crisis, data uncovered on their racist gang enforcement traffic stops, and the fact that 
a shameful 52% of people arrested are houseless.\n\nAdditionally and critically, Wheeler’s budget 
ELIMINATES $1.8 million to fund the police body camera program. More money for policing but less 
money for police accountability is completely unacceptable.\n\nI oppose any increases to the PPB budget. 
Over the course of last year, PPB increased their budget from the approved $227 million to $233 million 
– an increase that is easier for policing to achieve than most other departments. We anticipate that 
PPB will attempt a similar increase this year, pushing their budget even higher than the proposed $237 
million, thus we stand even more firmly against this increase. We also continue to oppose the proposed 
funding in this year’s budget for body cameras which are not shown to reduce the occurrence of police 
violence but rather are used to surveil and criminalize community members.\n\nWheeler’s proposed budget 
does have a few positive aspects, including a proposed reduction of $2 million in the budget due to 
vacancy of 75 police officer positions. However, at a minimum salary of $61,000 per entry level officer, 
this amount should total at least $4,575,000, not including costs of benefits and taxes for these 75 
vacant positions. Portland should continue to reduce the budget based on officer vacancy so that we move 
towards permanently reducing the number of police officers and reducing the budget. Care Not Cops 
supports the review and analysis of PPB directives and traffic stop data, however we demand this funding 
and all associated assessment be separated from the policing department.\n\nThe police budget increases 
regularly while other services are cut. I can see the ways in which policing continues to perpetuate 
violence against Black, brown, houseless people, and against people in mental health crisis. While 
Wheeler’s proposal represents a slight decrease from the PPB proposal, the PPB is a department whose 
reach into Portland communities needs to be curtailed through reducing the budget, not by increasing 
it.\n\nMore money for policing but less money for police accountability is completely unacceptable at 
this moment in history. The city, the state, and country are all watching. And so am I. I call on the Mayor, 
the Commissioners, and all other City Council Members to use their powers to continue to reduce the budget 
and pledge to increase Police accountability and transparency. I promise that you will lose my support and 
my vote if you aren’t willing to make a public and vocal stand to help defund the PPB and increase their 
accountability and transparency.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n
