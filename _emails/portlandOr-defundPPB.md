subject: Defunding the PPB & Increasing PPB Transparency
body: "I am a resident of [YOUR CITY/DISTRICT]. \n\nIn early May, Mayor Ted Wheeler
  released his proposed budget for the City of Portland. This included a policing
  budget of $236,991,195, which is over $10 million more than last year! The Portland
  Police Bureau (PPB), with Wheeler at its helm as Commissioner, has been mired in
  controversy over the last year with collusion with prominent white nationalist groups,
  shootings of Black people and people perceived to be in mental health crisis, data
  uncovered on their racist gang enforcement traffic stops, and the fact that a shameful
  52% of people arrested are houseless.\n\nAdditionally and critically, Wheeler's
  budget ELIMINATES $1.8 million to fund the police body camera program. More money
  for policing but less money for police accountability is completely unacceptable.\n\nI
  oppose any increases to the PPB budget. Over the course of last year, PPB increased
  their budget from the approved $227 million to $233 million - an increase that is
  easier for policing to achieve than most other departments. We anticipate that PPB
  will attempt a similar increase this year, pushing their budget even higher than
  the proposed $237 million, thus we stand even more firmly against this increase.
  We also continue to oppose the proposed funding in this year's budget for body cameras
  which are not shown to reduce the occurrence of police violence but rather are used
  to surveil and criminalize community members.\n\nWheeler's proposed budget does
  have a few positive aspects, including a proposed reduction of $2 million in the
  budget due to vacancy of 75 police officer positions. However, at a minimum salary
  of $61,000 per entry level officer, this amount should total at least $4,575,000,
  not including costs of benefits and taxes for these 75 vacant positions. Portland
  should continue to reduce the budget based on officer vacancy so that we move towards
  permanently reducing the number of police officers and reducing the budget. Care
  Not Cops supports the review and analysis of PPB directives and traffic stop data,
  however we demand this funding and all associated assessment be separated from the
  policing department.\n\nThe police budget increases regularly while other services
  are cut. I can see the ways in which policing continues to perpetuate violence against
  Black, brown, houseless people, and against people in mental health crisis. While
  Wheeler's proposal represents a slight decrease from the PPB proposal, the PPB is
  a department whose reach into Portland communities needs to be curtailed through
  reducing the budget, not by increasing it.\n\nMore money for policing but less money
  for police accountability is completely unacceptable at this moment in history.
  The city, the state, and country are all watching. And so am I. I call on the Mayor,
  the Commissioners, and all other City Council Members to use their powers to continue
  to reduce the budget and pledge to increase Police accountability and transparency.
  I promise that you will lose my support and my vote if you aren't willing to make
  a public and vocal stand to help defund the PPB and increase their accountability
  and transparency.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
