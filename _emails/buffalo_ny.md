subject: Buffalo Police Department Budget Reform and Action Plan
body: "To the Buffalo Common Council and Office of Mayor Byron Brown,\t\nI am [YOUR
  NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am imploring you to reconsider
  the Buffalo Police Department's $121.9 million dollar budget immediately. Buffalo
  Police officers pushed a non violent 75 year old man to the ground, while he was
  exercising his first amendment rights. In case you have not seen the footage, it
  is linked below. Many of these officers were not wearing masks during a global pandemic.
  The net budget for police public \"safety\" in the budget you passed yesterday is
  $121,931,696.\t\n\nI am calling for these officers to be charged and removed from
  service, effective immediately. I am calling for Mayor Brown and the Buffalo Common
  Council to have an emergency meeting regarding this matter. I am asking that an
  action plan for sustainable, longterm change is created and upheld.\t\n\nRecreational
  programming for the elderly is budgeted at $1,013,519.\t\n\nThe net budget for youth
  programs is $401,336.That is 30,281 PERCENT MORE of Buffalo taxpayer dollars spent
  on the police who walked past an elderly man bleeding from his head on our sidewalks
  than children. 30,281 PERCENT MORE resources to empower the person who pushed this
  man to the ground than kids who often rely on schools, now shut down due to the
  pandemic, to eat.\t\n\nBuffalo has the nation's fourth worst poverty rate for children.
  Almost half of our city's children live in poverty.\t\n\nWe want to know why are
  the majority of taxpayer dollars in one of the country's poorest city funding a
  Police department that has had 15 cases of alleged police brutality or excessive
  force since 2006, with 13 of the victims of those 15 cases, or 86 percent, being
  people of color? Quentin Suttles. Wilson Morales. A former Erie County Sheriff's
  Deputy assaulted someone at a tailgate party and was found guilty of falsifying
  records. Pito Rivera. Devin Ford. Troy Hodge. Marcus Neal. Shaun Porter was brutally
  beaten while an inmate in handcuffs while officers Joshua Craig and Anthony D'Agostino
  watched and laughed. Shaun was given a $300,000 settlement by you, the Common Council.
  Four black teenagers Gregory Kwaiatkowski assaulted and called \"savage dogs.\"
  Kwaiatowski also choked David N. Mack in 2006. Kwaiatkowski was sentenced to four
  months in prison in 2018 for pleading guilty in December 2016 to a civil rights
  violation dating back to 2009. Timothy Stanton, Jr. Jose Hernandez-Rossy (at a traffic
  stop). Wardel \"Meech\" Davis, who died in police custody. National Air Guardsman
  William Sager who was handcuffed while unconscious and later died after being pushed
  down a flight of stairs by a bar manager. John T. Willet, a Black man, was kicked
  and slapped while handcuffed on the ground by Buffalo Police officer John Cirulli,
  who was sentenced to a year of probation. Cirulli resigned and pleaded guilty to
  two federal misdemeanor civil rights violations earlier in 2014.\t\n\nThis is unacceptable.
  We are calling on the Buffalo Common Council, Buffalo Police Commissioner, and Mayor
  Byron Brown to reduce the Buffalo Police department's budget, revise all training
  practices for police officers to include de-escalation and adopt Campaign Zero's
  cant wait policies, and re-allocate police funding to invest in our community--as
  a start. Many of these altercations involved drugs. Drug use is the product of poverty.
  Improving our educational system, local opportunities for economic growth, programs
  that fight hunger, foster neighborhood communities, and housing will combat the
  root of these altercations--as a start.\t\n\nHow are you going to show up for a
  city in desperate need of help? How are Because spending $121.9 million dollars
  on the Buffalo Police is not the solution.\t\n\nSincerely,\t\n[YOUR NAME]\t\n[YOUR
  ADDRESS]\t\n[YOUR EMAIL]\t\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\t\n\nSources --\t\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/buffalo-police-suspension-shoving-man-trnd/index.html\t\nhttps://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2019/01/15/buffalo-posts-the-nations-fourth-worst-poverty.html\t\nhttps://buffalonews.com/2020/01/01/lagging-in-2020-buffalo-needs-to-close-gaps-to-prosper-by-2030/\t\nhttps://www.wkbw.com/news/i-team/15-cases-of-alleged-police-brutality-excessive-force-in-wny-since-2006\t\nhttps://www.joincampaignzero.org/"
