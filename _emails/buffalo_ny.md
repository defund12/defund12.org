subject: Buffalo Police Department Budget Reform and Action Plan
body: "To the Buffalo Common Council and Office of Mayor Byron Brown, \n\nMy name
  is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am imploring you to
  reconsider the Buffalo Police Department's $121.9 million dollar budget immediately.
  On June 5, Buffalo Police officers pushed a non-violent 75 year old man to the ground
  while he was exercising his first amendment rights. In case you have not seen the
  footage, it is linked below. \n\nI am calling for these officers to be charged and
  removed from service, effective immediately. I am calling for Mayor Brown and the
  Buffalo Common Council to have an emergency meeting regarding this matter. I am
  asking that an action plan for sustainable, long-term change is created and upheld.
  \n\nRecreational programming for the elderly is budgeted at $1M, while the net budget
  for youth programs is $401K. Buffalo has the nation's fourth worst poverty rate
  for children, with almost one half of children in Buffalo living in poverty. The
  police were allocated 30,000% more funding than our city’s youth in the 2019-20
  city budget. \n\nIn one of this country’s poorest cities, the majority of taxpayer
  dollars are funding a police department that has had 15 cases of alleged police
  brutality or excessive force since 2006. Of those 15 victims, 13 of them, or 86%,
  were people of color. An outline of these cases are included as a post-script to
  this email, alongside my sources.\n\nThis is unacceptable, and I am calling on the
  Buffalo Common Council, Buffalo Police Commissioner, and Mayor Byron Brown to reduce
  the Buffalo Police department's budget, revise all training practices for police
  officers to include de-escalation and adopt Campaign Zero's cant wait policies,
  and re-allocate police funding to invest in our community--as a start. Improving
  our educational system, local opportunities for economic growth, programs that fight
  hunger, foster neighborhood communities, and housing will combat the root of these
  altercations--as a start. \n\nHow will you show up for a city in desperate need
  of help? Spending $121.9 million dollars on the Buffalo Police is not the solution.
  \n\nSincerely, \n[YOUR NAME] \n[YOUR ADDRESS] \n[YOUR EMAIL] \n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
