subject: We Demand Divestment from Police and an Investment in Black Communities
body: "\nHello,\n\nMy name is [NAME]. I am a resident of Dallas, Texas and I am emailing
  today to demand a complete overhaul on our Dallas Police Department in light of
  the Black Lives Matter protests being demonstrated across the US, but specifically
  our city.\n\nWE ARE JOINING TOGETHER TO DEMAND THAT YOU, MY LOCAL OFFICIALS, WILL:
  \n\n1. Vote no on all increases to police budgets \n2. Vote yes to decrease police
  spending and budgets \n3. Vote yes to increase spending on Health care, education
  and community programs that keep us safe.\n\nThe militarized tactics that our Police
  Department have used against its citizens in response to peaceful protesting is
  unacceptable and unwarranted. To ensure your dedication to our city and citizens,
  I demand that you defund the Dallas Police Department and start providing more support
  and funding towards our community efforts and organizations that serve our predominantly
  Latinx and Black communities, as these are the communities that are being targeted
  the most. By doing so, I believe this will prevent further police brutality and
  violence in the future.\n\nThe Dallas Police Department said that “(they) are dedicated
  to serving the people of Dallas and strives to reduce crime and provide a safe city.”
  If this true, we demand you listen to our concerns and implement change immediately.\n\nBlack
  communities are living in persistent fear of being killed by state authorities like
  police, immigration agents or even white vigilantes who are emboldened by state
  actors. According to the Urban Institute, in 1977, state and local governments spent
  $60 billion on police and corrections . In 2017, they spent $194 billion. A 220
  percent increase. Despite continued profiling, harassment, terror and killing of
  Black communities, local and federal decision-makers continue to invest in the police,
  which leaves Black people vulnerable and our communities no safer.\n  \nWhere could
  that money go? It could go towards building healthy communities, to the health of
  our elders and children,to neighborhood infrastructure, to education, to childcare,
  to support a vibrant Black future. The possibilities are endless. \n  \nWe join
  in solidarity with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis, Louisville, and across the
  United States. And we call for the end to police terror.\n\nSincerely,\n[NAME]\n[PHONE_NUMBER]\n[EMAIL]\n[ADDRESS]\n"
