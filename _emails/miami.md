subject: Commit to reallocate for social equity / Defund the MPD
body: "Hello, \n\nMy name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY]. I
  am extremely concerned with the City of Miami’s inordinate investment in the Miami
  Police Department (MPD) at the expense of critical youth, education, and health
  services. As demonstrated by ongoing peaceful protests and a 2019 Gallup poll, a
  majority of individuals living in Miami view the police negatively. \n\nI am therefore
  writing to demand that the City Council vote to reapportion funds allocated to the
  MPD to support evidence-based programs and services that, unlike increased police
  presence, promote the well-being of citizens and reduce crime. It is morally reprehensible
  to dedicate 40% of the City’s operating budget (approximately $4 million per day)
  towards policing while thousands of citizens are homeless and many more lack access
  to essential services, including clean running water and necessary mental health
  resources. The divestment of police department funding can translate to contributions toward budget 
  shortfalls impacted by COVID-19 and/or services for the homeless, youth development, and workforce development --- all of which crucial to commanities of color.
  Your budget is not a moral document, rather, let's spend taxpayer money that
  speaks to our values. \n\nPeople are marching in the streets because they know that these actions 
  will result in a healthier, more just society. I am asking that city officials lobby the 
  same amount of attention and effort towards finding sustainable, longterm change.
  \n\nThank you, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR
  PHONE NUMBER]\n"
