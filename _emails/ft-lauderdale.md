subject: Commit to reallocate for social equity / Defund the FLPD
body: "Hello, \n\nMy name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY]. I
  am extremely concerned with the City of Fort Lauderdale’s inordinate investment in the Fort Lauderdale
  Police Department (MPD) at the expense of critical youth, education, senior, and health
  services. As demonstrated by ongoing peaceful protests and a 2019 Gallup poll, a
  majority of individuals living in Fort Lauderdale view the police negatively. \n\nI am therefore
  writing to demand that the City Council vote to reapportion funds allocated to the
  MPD to support evidence-based programs and services that, unlike increased police
  presence, promote the well-being of citizens and reduce crime. It is morally reprehensible
  to dedicate 130.4 million dollars of the City’s operating budget (the budget's highest expenditure)
  towards policing while thousands of citizens are homeless and many more lack access
  to essential services, including clean running water and necessary mental health
  resources. \n\nI also urge the City Council to enact legislation that holds police
  accountable and to overturn policies that allow police to engage in unlawful behavior
  with impunity. As set forth by Black Lives Matter of Fort Lauderdale, I ask that Homan Square
  be immediately closed (a site where extrajudicial police interrogations are known
  to occur), that an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council be established
  with real reform powers, and that abusive cops be fired and criminally charged.
  Ending the unfair and secretive internal FLPD grievance review process would be a
  good first step in achieving this goal. \n\nPeople are marching in the streets because
  they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore
  you to please listen to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action
  to address their concerns. \n\nThank you, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR
  PHONE NUMBER]\n"
