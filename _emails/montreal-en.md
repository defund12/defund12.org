subject: 2020 SPVM Budget — Call For Action — DEFUND NOW
body: "To the City of Montreal elected officials:

I am writing to you today to express my absolute outrage regarding the operational budget of the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM), which is $665,300,000 (source: Budget 2020 [1]). This comprises nearly 11% of the annual budget for the City of Montreal. The size of our city’s police budget is reprehensible considering our constantly crumbling infrastructure [2] and contaminated drinking water [3].

While the SPVM is meant to protect Montrealers and maintain peace and security, our city is made unsafe by the willingness to finance racial profiling and excessive force. The SPVM, like all police departments in North America, has a long history of killing innocent, unarmed black people and it is imperative that our city leadership do their part to ensure it never happens again.

Anthony Griffin (1987), Preslie Leslie (1990), Osmond Fletcher (1991), Marcellus François (1991), Trevor Kelly (1993), Anas Bennis (2004), Fredy Villanueva (2008), Mario Hamel (2011), Patrick Limoges (2011), Alain Magloire (2013), René Gallant (2015), Bony Jean-Pierre (2016), Pierre Coriolan (2017) and Nicholas Gibbs (2018) are some names of people who have died at the hands of the SPVM (source: “Another Black Life” by Robyn Maynard [4]).

I call upon our elected officials to start divesting from the inherently violent institution that is the SPVM. I am asking that you, as an elected official, pledge to do the following:

- To never again vote to increase the SPVM’s budget. This includes funding for police body cams, an initiative that has been shown to fall short of its goals [5] and which ultimately legitimizes a fundamentally flawed institution.

- To propose and implement a SPVM budget cut of, at the absolute minimum, $300 million in accordance with the City of Montreal’s operating budget shortfall projections due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- To prioritize the expansion of community-led health and safety initiatives, community oversight committees for police officers, independently investigate and prosecute officers who violate the law and basic human rights, and to redirect more funding toward infrastructure, affordable housing and other programs that better the quality of life for Montrealers.

In the face of cyclical police violence happening throughout North America right now, there is no better time to commit ourselves to change. What we need in Montreal is leadership that can initiate reform that aims toward the eventual abolition of police and prisons—and, in turn, the immense police violence that targets our most marginalized people. An increased police presence does not keep us safe; rather, it directly threatens the lives of our most vulnerable communities, such as Black communities, Indigenous communities, LGBTQ2S+ communities, homeless people, street-based sex workers, people with disabilities, and people experiencing poverty.

It is impossible to effectively reform the police to protect the marginalized communities they were designed to target. Therefore, we must choose to transition towards abolition [6]. Instead of investing in the police, our city must prioritize alternatives like education, increased mental health services, affordable housing initiatives, income security, harm reduction services, accessible rehabilitation, mutual aid, social workers, conflict resolution services, transformative justice, and other vital community-based support systems.

When you were elected to office, you entered a contract to represent me. Failing to take action against police brutality and the SPVM’s racist practices is a failure to represent me and my concerned community. If all you can offer are the same cliche platitudes, then I ask that you resign and make way for real leadership in our city.

Thank you for taking the time to think critically about this issue.

Yours sincerely,
