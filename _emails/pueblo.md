    Dear Mayor Gradisar and City Council Members,
    
    I write to demand a reallocation of funding from Pueblo PD to social and public programming that takes place in our communities, and demand regulation to ensure oversight for public spending.

    I join the calls of those across the country to Defund the Police. With record unemployment and a seemingly intractable pattern of abuse an unequal treatment by police, we need a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Pueblo residents. You must support a budget that supports social equity in our community, rather than empowering the police forces that tear us apart.

    It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to advocate for revision of the Pueblo city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, to reflect the decades of research showing that education and social programs much better promote the safety of a city than policing.

    Thank you for your time,
