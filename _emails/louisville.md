subject: Reallocate Funding for the LMPD
body: |
  Hello,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY]. I am extremely concerned with the Louisville Metro Government’s inordinate investment in the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) in light of the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year old Black woman who was killed by three LMPD police officers earlier this year on March 13th. The case, which has made national headlines, has drawn rebuke and protest from thousands of people in the metro area, along with its mishandling and lack of appropriate corrective actions regarding the officers involved.

  I am therefore writing to demand that the Metro Council consider reapportion of general funds away from the LMPD and towards the existing Criminal Justice Commission, social services and education programs, effective at the beginning of FY21, July 1, 2020. It is morally reprehensible to dedicate over $190 million dollars of the city’s available funds (approximately 32%), with only $4 million allocated to the Criminal Justice Commission and much less to various social services, while increasing police presence and allowing condemnable actions from LMPD officers to go unexcused. Through a reallocation of funds, we can promote the well-being of citizens and reduce crime by sourcing community-based solutions, allowing residents to become invested in providing recommendations for improvements in criminal justice system operations and to engage in creating solutions that best serve their communities and their needs.

  I also urge Metro Council to enact legislation that holds police members accountable and to overturn policies that allow police members to engage in unlawful behavior with impunity, that an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council be established with real reform powers, and that abusive or reckless officers, including the officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death, be fired and criminally charged. Ending any unfair secretive internal LMPD review process would be a good first step in achieving this goal.

  I ask that all council members lobby the same amount of attention and effort towards fostering sustainable, long-term change, to prevent further tragedies at the hands of the police, and to take immediate action for the well-being of all of our residents.

  Thank you,
