subject: San Francisco Resident for Defunding the SFPD
body: |-
  To Mayor Breed, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and San Francisco Elected Officers

  My name is \[YOUR NAME\], and I am a resident of San Francisco. This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-blackness, and immediate reform in how black people are treated in America. Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for 2021 is being decided as these protests continue.

  SFPD has been a waste of our resources. Last year, the SFPD budget was $611,701,869, the majority of which comes from the San Francisco general fund. While we've been spending extraordinary amounts on policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our city. Instead, we see wasteful and harmful actions of our police.

  I call on you to slash the SFPD budget and instead use those extraordinary resources towards solving homelessness, which is felt most by our black neighbors and veterans. We implore you to give every member of our community experiencing homelessness a place to call home and the treatment they need.

  We can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change.

  Sincerely,

  \[YOUR NAME\]
