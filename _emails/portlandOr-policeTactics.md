subject: Disturbing Police Tactics
body: "Hello,\n\nI am a [YOUR CITY/DISTRICT] resident. I have been following the recent
  protests against police brutality, and I am increasingly disturbed by the use of
  force by police in this city. There are plenty of videos showing police attacking
  citizens over the past few days, usually unprovoked and without discretion. Tonight,
  there was no curfew in place and yet still police used violent force in the name
  of \"dispersing crowds\". The constitution is very clear about the peoples' First
  Amendment rights to peacefully assemble.\n\nI've linked to a few videos of PPB using
  terror tactics on citizens tonight:\nhttps://twitter.com/matcha_chai/status/1268043556913987584\nhttps://twitter.com/CAIROregon/status/1268039476938305536\nhttps://twitter.com/alex_zee/status/1268047762848800768\nHere's
  the PPB's reasoning for using chemical weapons on citizens: https://twitter.com/PortlandPolice/status/1268042456148271104\n\nIf
  I'm to understand -- the issue is that they were too close to a fence? So the police
  were authorized to use chemical weapons and 40mm bullets on citizens? It is increasingly
  clear that the most violent actors in our city are the police. If their terror tactics
  are the result of orders from the Chief and the Police Commissioner, then you both
  must step down immediately. If they are NOT acting under the direct orders of the
  Chief and the Commissioner, then you must investigate the actions of these officers.\n\nThe
  PPB's behaviors this weekend are offensive to me. Tonight is absolute proof that
  the police MUST be defunded and have their military-grade weapons taken away --
  it is a danger to the citizens of Portland to allow police to continue using violent
  force and chemical weapons on the citizens of our city who are protesting that very
  same force. It is clear to me that the brutality the protesters are fighting against
  is alive and well in our city.\n\nPolice reform is not enough, and has proven time
  and time again to be ineffective at reducing police killings and brutality \n[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why].
  \nBody cams do not equal accountability and bias training does not reduce the number
  of Black people, Indigenous people, Latinx people and others disproportionately
  targeted by \"law enforcement\".\n\nIf you want to \"tackle crime\", dedicate yourselves
  fully to ending poverty-- don't give the police force another 246.2 million to spend
  on riot gear, grenades, and chemical weapons to use against your city.\n\nNow is
  a chance for Portland to lead the country and show how demilitarization and defunding
  the police can create a safer city for all of us.\n\nBest Regards,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR
  ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
