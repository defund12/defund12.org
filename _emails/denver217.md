subject: We Demand a People's Budget
body: |-
  Hello,

  I am a resident of Denver. I am writing to demand that Denver and Colorado adopt a People’s Budget that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police.

  We will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” This includes the statewide Senate Bill 217, being referred to as the “police accountability” bill. This bill does not do enough to address our systemic policing problems in our state and Denver. The bill will increase police budgets by $1.4 million, and will most likely increase spending on police departments even more in the future.

  We are demanding that our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources. We demand to drastically reduce the Denver Police Department’s budget. DPD is overfunded and holds responsibility over community issues that they are fundamentally unable to address. They have shown to be consistently racist and abusive ways towards Denver’s residents.

  We demand that the City Council meaningfully defund the Denver Police Department. We join the calls of those across the country to #DefundThePolice. We demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Denver residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.

  We must divest from policing funds, and invest in a people’s budget. We are in the midst of a pandemic with severe economic consequences. Colorado unemployment is at historic highs, with more than 430,000 unemployment claims filed and processed since March 14th, 2020. The evictions and economic insecurity caused by COVID-19 will demand strength and resolve in our communities. Divesting from DPD and investing in our communities has never been more important.

  I am eager to see how you will address these issues, which I will fight for until they are meaningfully addressed.

  Thank you for your time,
