subject: Commit to reallocate for social equity
body: "Dear Suffolk County Legislature, \n\nHi, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident
  of [TOWN]. I am asking you to reallocate money away from the Suffolk County PD,
  which disproportionately targets black residents. From traffic stops, to arrests,
  to the use of lethal force, Suffolk PD targets nonwhite residents at a rate far
  exceeding their share of the population. Much scholarship shows that a living wage,
  access to health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing
  are far more successful at promoting community safety than policing and prisons.
  As such, I demand a meaningful reallocation of PD funds towards healthcare and social
  programs. \n\nSincerely, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE
  NUMBER]\n"
