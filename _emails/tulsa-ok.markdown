subject: Reallocate for Justice
body: "Dear Tulsa City Council and County Commissioners,\n\nMy name is \\[YOUR NAME\\]
  and I am a resident of \\[NEIGHBORHOOD/WARD\\].  The City of Tulsa must do better
  by its residents. I am urging you to divest from the criminalization of our community
  and reduce police spending in the budget for the 2021 fiscal year. The Tulsa City
  Council will review and discuss the Mayor’s proposed budget and must approve a budget
  for the upcoming fiscal year at least seven days prior to June 30, the end of the
  City’s fiscal year. After the budget has been approved, Fiscal Year 20 -21 will
  begin July 1.\n\nAs a Tulsan, I demand the Mayor and City Council amend the proposed
  budget in order to create an ethical reallocation of the city’s expenditures towards
  sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and class inequality. This includes,
  but is not limited to improving access to health services and treatment, educational
  opportunity, and stable housing, which have proven far more successful at promoting
  community safety and social equity than policing. As such, I demand more aggressive
  financial support be directed to those areas.\n\nTulsa is the site of one of the
  greatest race massacres in our nation's history. Just days ago was the 99th Anniversary
  of the Tulsa Race Massacre, yet our Black friends and neighbors in this city are
  still under attack. I know many of you feel strongly about racial justice and equity.
  It is time to take action. Individual solutions will not fix systemic problems.
  It is time for Tulsa, its leaders, and residents to create a more equitable city
  for ALL of us. Have the moral clarity to create a budget focused on communities
  instead of investing in a racist and destructive institution. Defund the Tulsa Police
  Department.\n\nThank you, \n\\[NAME\\] \n\\[ADDRESS\\]\n\\[EMAIL\\]\n\\[PHONE NUMBER\\]"
