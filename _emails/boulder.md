  Dear Council Members of the City of Boulder,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am writing to you regarding the harassment of Zayd Atkinson, a resident of Boulder and a student at Naropa University, by the Boulder Police Department. Instead of funding the harassment of Boulder residents of color, the city should fund affordable housing.

  Several council members have based their campaigns on a platform that supports affordable housing for the residents of Boulder, yet no laws have changed regarding the number of unrelated people who can live together in a house. The budget for the Boulder Police Department is $37,000,000 while the budget for Housing and Human Services is less than $5,000,000. I strongly suggest that the Boulder Police Department be defunded immediately and that the money go towards creating affordable housing within city limits.

  Thank you for your time,
