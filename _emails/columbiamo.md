subject: Defund the Columbia Police Department
body: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of Columbia's [YOUR COUNCIL WARD].
  I am asking to redirect money away from the Columbia PD and into the public services
  such as housing, education, and healthcare access, and to consider direct financial
  relief to citizens, not just businesses, impacted by COVID-19. \n As it stands,
  our city is facing massive revenue shortfalls due to conditions created by the Covid-19
  Pandemic. Rather than see further reduction to public services and layoffs of essential
  public workers, I request that the mayor and city council first and foremost consider
  significantly defunding the police department. Police spending for the FY20 budget
  increased by 12%. This money can be more effectively spent in other ways to keep
  Columbia citizens safe. \nThank you for your time, \n\n[NAME] \n\n[ADDRESS] \n\n[EMAIL]
