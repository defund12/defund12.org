subject: DC Resident for Defunding the Metropolitan Police Department
body: |
  To the DC council in charge of the allocation of funds to the Metropolitan Police Department and its respective members, 

My name is [your name], and I am a resident of Washington, D.C. This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-blackness, and immediate reform in how black people are treated in America. Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that there will be a council meeting in June that will discuss the budget for the Metropolitan Police Department. 

The MPD is a pillar of inequality in our city. Just last year, it was reported that most police stops involved Black people. I am concerned that the proposed increase/or the upcoming fiscal year will only serve to entrench this prejudice and worsen the disproportionate impact on Black DC residents. 

The brutal, senseless, and violent murder of George Floyd at the hands of police officers derelict in their duties to protect and serve is deeply disturbing. We, as a nation, are in need of a drastic overhaul in policing. Systems of oppression must be undone, and reallocating much of the budget for the MPD to programs and city-led initiatives that support education, rehabilitation, public health, and community-oriented initiatives is a goal that must be achieved. I implore you to reconsider the upcoming budget. We are overdue for change. 

Sincerely, 
[your name]
