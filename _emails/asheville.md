subject: Redirect money away from Asheville Police Department’s budget
body: "Dear Asheville City Councilmembers, \n\nMy name is [x] and I’m a resident of
  Asheville. I am writing about Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer’s fiscal year 2021
  budget proposal.\n\nI am asking that the Asheville City Council make a more overt
  and visible commitment to racial justice. I demand that the budget vote be delayed
  so that Council may find ways to redirect money away from Asheville Police Department’s
  overinflated budget. I urge you to pressure the City Manager’s Office towards an
  ethical and equal reallocation of the city’s expenditures, away from APD, and towards
  sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and class inequality. \n\nResearch
  shows that a living wage, access to holistic health services and treatment, educational
  opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at reducing crime than police
  or prisons (Source: Popular Democracy). As such, I demand more aggressive financial
  support be directed to those areas.\n\nDo not forget our poor communities and communities
  of color who are disproportionate targets of police violence. Justice will only
  be served when the police are reformed, and this will not be possible until we defund
  them. \n\nCan I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus
  on social service programs? \n\nThank you,\n\n[x]\n"
