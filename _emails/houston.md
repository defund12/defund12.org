subject: We Demand Divestment from Police and an Investment in Black Communities
body: "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I live in [CITY/NEIGHBORHOOD].\n\nWE ARE JOINING
  TOGETHER TO DEMAND THAT YOU, MY LOCAL OFFICIALS, WILL: \n\n1. Vote no on all increases
  to police budgets \n2. Vote yes to decrease police spending and budgets \n3. Vote
  yes to increase spending on Health care, education and community programs that keep
  us safe.\n\nBlack communities across the nation are mourning the deaths of George
  Floyd, tortured to death by Minneapolis police, Ahmaud Arbery, a jogger who was
  killed while running in a residential neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia, Breonna
  Taylor an EMT killed while asleep in her bed in Louisville,KY, Dreasjon Reed in
  Indianapolis and Tony McDade in Tallahassee. Their names are added to a devastatingly
  long list of Black people who have been killed at the hands of vigilantes or law
  enforcement. Not to mention the others whose names we don’t yet know, and may never
  know since they were killed without a camera recording it.\n\nAt the same time,
  the United States leads the world in COVID-19 cases. So far, more than 100,000 people
  — enough to fill a football stadium– have perished from the virus,with over one
  million cases confirmed, and those numbers don’t reflect all the people dying from
  virus-related illnesses. Black people are suffering disproportionately from COVID-19,
  four times more likely to die than their white neighbors. \n\nIt is important to
  state this within the context of the scourge of anti-Black police terror and the
  resulting uprisings taking place across the U.S. \n\nThe COVID-19 deaths and the
  deaths caused by police terror are connected and consequential to each other. The
  United States does not have a national healthcare system. Instead, we have the largest
  military budget in the world, and some of the most well-funded and militarized police
  departments in the world, too. Policing and militarization overwhelmingly dominate
  the bulk of national and local budgets. In fact, police and military funding has
  increased every single year since 1973, and  at the same time, funding for public
  health decreased every year, crystallized  most recently when the Trump administration
  eliminated the US Pandemic Response Team in 2018, citing “costs”. \n\nBlack communities
  are living in persistent fear of being killed by state authorities like police,
  immigration agents or even white vigilantes who are emboldened by state actors.
  According to the Urban Institute, in 1977, state and local governments spent $60
  billion on police and corrections . In 2017, they spent $194 billion. A 220 percent
  increase. Despite continued profiling, harassment, terror and killing of Black communities,
  local and federal decision-makers continue to invest in the police, which leaves
  Black people vulnerable and our communities no safer.\n\nWhere could that money
  go? It could go towards building healthy communities, to the health of our elders
  and children,to neighborhood infrastructure, to education, to childcare, to support
  a vibrant Black future. The possibilities are endless. \n\nWe join in solidarity
  with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis, Louisville, and across the United States.
  And we call for the end to police terror. \n\nSincerely,\nThe People of Houston,
  TX\n[NAME]\n[PHONE_NUMBER]\n[EMAIL]\n[ADDRESS]\n"
