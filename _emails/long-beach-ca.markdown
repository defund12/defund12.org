  Dear Long Beach Mayor and City Council,

  My name is \[YOUR NAME\], I am a resident of \[YOUR DISTRICT\]. I am demanding reallocation of funding from LBPD to social and public programming that takes place in our communities. It is an outrage that 48.3% of the city funding for 2021 is planned to be allocated to the Police Department and that Chief Lunaâ€™s salary is equivalent to that of the president of the United States.

  I demand that the City Council meaningfully defund the LBPD. I join the calls of those across the country to defund the police. I am demanding a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Long Beach residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. I am demanding a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowering the police forces that tear them apart.

  It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the Long Beach city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund the social programs long proven to be much more effective than policing at promoting community safety and equity. Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,
  \[YOUR NAME\]
