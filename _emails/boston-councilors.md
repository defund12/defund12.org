subject: Reduce the Boston Police Department budget
body: "Dear City Councilors,\n\nThe City of Boston must reduce the Boston Police Department
  budget. The City Council needs to address a lack of investment in predominantly
  Black and Brown communities and an over-investment in their criminalization and
  surveillance including spending on the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC).\n\nThe
  City Council is considering a grant of $850,000 from the Executive of Public Safety
  to spend on the BRIC, in addition to $4 million in the City Budget and other federal
  funding from Trump’s Department of Homeland Security. The City Council should not
  authorize the grant and should cut the BRIC line item from our city budget. BRIC
  manages the racist gang database and invasive surveillance that disproportionately
  targets Black and Brown residents.\nWith the overall police budget, the City Council
  has the power to cut line items in the City budget. The police budget and overtime
  budget should be cut, with funds reinvested in Black and POC communities including
  $15 million this year for youth jobs.\n\nNow especially, the City Council can take
  a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in
  Black and Brown communities - starting with cutting the least transparent and most
  harmful parts of the BPD budget.\n\nRacist police violence doesn’t just happen in
  other cities - it happens here in Boston too.  The City Council must stop investing
  in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and Brown communities
  need to be safe and healthy: COVID19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, healing,
  cooperative businesses, community centers, community-led organizations and projects.
  \n\nThank you,\n[Name/Location]\n"
