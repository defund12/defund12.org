subject: DEFUND SPD and reallocate egregious police budgets towards education, social
  services, and dismantling racial inequality
body: "Dear Seattle City Leadership, \n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident
  of [YOUR DISTRICT]. I am writing to demand that the City Council adopt a People’s
  Budget that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from the
  police.\n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence
  of policing, embodied by the SPD’s well documented history of murdering Black people.
  We will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” We are demanding
  that our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city
  allocates its resources.\n\nRather than prioritize the quality of life for all of
  Seattle with a proportional housing and development budget, Mayor Durkan chooses
  to prioritize the SPD. In the 2019-2020 proposed budget, the funding for the Office
  of Housing, which provides grants for affordable housing, remained unchanged at
  only $69.1 million. In comparison, the SPD was allocated a budget of $363 million,
  representing a 9.7% increase in funds.\n\nWe are in the midst of a pandemic with
  severe economic consequences. When people are unemployed, they cannot pay rent.
  Prior to the pandemic, 60k people were unhoused; the evictions and economic insecurity
  caused by COVID-19 will bring that number even higher.\n\nSupport for communities
  in need is necessary now, more than ever. But instead, the Mayor has proposed an
  increase in funding to the SPD, despite the fact that crime has fallen considerably
  during the past few months. The SPD has seen a rise in overtime pay which, more
  often than not, is paid out to officers responsible for harassing the unhoused,
  and Black, Indigenous, people of color.\n\nWe demand that the City Council defund
  the SPD. We join the calls of those across the country to #DefundThePolice. We demand
  a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Seattleites
  during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand
  a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces
  that tear them apart.\n\nAlthough City Council has avoided voting or revising Mayor
  Durkan's draconian (fine?) budget proposal, the document is back in your hands.
  It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise
  the Seattle budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund #CareNotCops. You need
  to adopt a People’s Budget. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
