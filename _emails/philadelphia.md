subject: Commit to reallocate for social equity / Defund the PPD
body: "Dear Philadelphia City Council, \n\nMy name is [NAME], and I am a resident
  of [District/Neighborhood]. Mayor Kenney’s proposed Philadelphia budget for fiscal
  year 2021 has proposed a $14 million increase for the Philadelphia police department
  during a time of economic strife and while other essential social budgets that support
  the community are being slashed. For example, budgets for library, homeless services,
  Parks and Recreation, and public health (during the global COVID-19 pandemic!) are
  all being cut and the city is eliminating its budget for arts and culture entirely.
  \n\nI urge you to advocate for an ethical reallocation of funds: away from PPD,
  and towards social services and education programs. \n\nI am emailing to ask city
  officials to please reject any proposed budget that increases taxpayer spending
  on police while cutting funding for important social and community projects. I am
  asking that city officials lobby the same amount of attention and effort towards
  finding sustainable, long term change. \n\nBlack Lives Matter. \nSincerely, \n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"

subject: Philadelphia demands a People's Budget
body: |
 To whom it may concern: 

 My name is [INSERT NAME], and I am a resident of the [DISTRICT NUMBER] district. I am emailing to demand the restructuring of the Philadelphia city budget in a way that prioritizes social services for communities and drastically minimizes spending on police. 

 We are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing, embodied by the PPD's well documented history of disproportionately enacting violence against Black communities. We will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” We are demanding that our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.

 The proposed $14 million budget increase for PPD is unacceptable and comes at the cost of affordable housing, support for essential city workers, and other transformative initiatives. These programs are needed now more than ever to alleviate the harms of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for Black and Brown communities. I ask that the mayor, city managing director, and city council members prove their love and dedication to the people of this city and reallocate funds to directly benefit those in need.

 Thank you for your time,
