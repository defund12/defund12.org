subject: Proposal for People's Budget of Grand Rapids
body: "Hello, \n\nMy name is [INSERT NAME] and I live in [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am
  writing to ask that you to call an emergency council meeting and challenge the mayor’s
  proposed budget in favor of The People’s Budget before the budget is adopted on
  July 1st. \n\nI know that public services are set to be cut by $22M by FY2021. I
  think that this is unacceptable, and ask that funds be redirected away from the
  Grand Rapids Police Department and into public services such as housing, education,
  and healthcare access, and to consider direct financial relief to citizens, not
  just businesses, impacted by COVID-19. \n\nThis funding must be allocated in a way
  that provides relief to those in our community that are marginalized and victimized
  by the structural racism and inequity that Grand Rapids is built upon, and that
  the Grand Rapids Police Department and your City Commission are complicit in enforcing.
  Public tensions are rising and public opinion is dwindling in regard to the City’s
  inappropriate response to the murder of George Floyd and militarized, over-policed
  response to subsequent protests of police brutality and racism.\n\nThank you for
  your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\"\n"
