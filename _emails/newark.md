subject: 'Newark Demands Equity: Police Budget and Reform'
body: "Hello, \n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of Newark. I urge you
  to redirect money away from the NPD and into social service programs that will benefit
  public health and our own communities. We also need to ban chokeholds, strangleholds,
  shooting at moving vehicles, and require police officers to practice de-escalation
  and comprehensive reporting (8cantwait.org).\n\nNewark's 2019 Municipal Budget shows
  that $154,625,090 was spent on the Division of Police. This is by far the largest
  fraction of the city's budget, which is over double the second largest allocation
  of funds (Division of Fire's $72,354,451). It's an egregious statistic compared
  to $9,407,451 spent on the entire Department of Health and Community Wellness, $3,504,842
  on the Department of Economic and Housing Development, and just $359,239 to the
  Division of Cultural Affairs. If this is truly representative of the council’s thoughts
  on how funds should be allocated in a city in which one in every 3.5 residents live
  in poverty (see source below), I am ashamed to call Newark my home.\n\nI am writing
  to demand that the budget will be spent promoting the safety and well-being of Newark's
  current residents, rather than arresting, displacing, or incarcerating my neighbors.
  We don't need a militarized police force. To fight crime, we need to create a space
  in which more mental health service providers, social workers, victim/survivor advocates,
  religious leaders, neighbors, and friends - all of the people who really make up
  our community - can look out for one another. I am writing to insist that the upcoming
  budget hearings for FY 2021 reflect the voices and needs of Newark’s citizens and
  that changes are made to NPD's policies. \n\nMayor Baraka and city councilors, will
  you look out for me and our beloved community?\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR
  ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE]\n\nPoverty source: https://www.welfareinfo.org/poverty-rate/new-jersey/newark#:~:text=The%20poverty%20rate%20in%20Newark%20is%2028.3%25.,line%20in%20the%20last%20year"
