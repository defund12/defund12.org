subject: Oakland Resident for Defunding the OPD
body: "\"To Mayor Schaaf, the Oakland City Council and Oakland and Alameda County
  Elected Officials\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Oakland. This
  past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful
  change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-Blackness, and
  immediate reform in how Black people are treated in America. Our city has been at
  the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that
  the budget for 2021 is being decided as these protests continue.\n\nOPD has been
  a waste of our resources. Last year, the OPD budget was approximately half of available
  discretionary funds. While weâ€™ve been spending extraordinary amounts on policing,
  we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability
  in our city. Instead, we see wasteful and harmful actions of our police.\n\nI call
  on you to slash the OPD budget and instead use those extraordinary resources towards
  solving homelessness, which is felt most by our Black neighbors and veterans. We
  can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR
  NAME] \n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\"\n"
