subject: Reduce the Albuquerque Police Department Budget and Invest in Our Community
body: "\nHello,\n\nMy name is [NAME]. I am a resident of [CITY/NEIGHBORHOOD], and I am emailing 
  today to demand an overhaul to our Albuquerque Police Department budget in light of 
  the Black Lives Matter protests being demonstrated across the US, but specifically 
  our city.\n\nWE ARE JOINING TOGETHER TO DEMAND THAT YOU, MY LOCAL OFFICIALS, WILL:
  \n\n1. Vote no on all increases to police budgets \n2. Vote yes to decrease police 
  spending and budgets \n3. Vote yes to increase spending on healthcare, education, housing,  
  and community programs that keep us safe.\n\nThe militarized tactics that police 
  departments are using against citizens is unacceptable and unwarranted. We have seen 
  mounting evidence that police departments are racist and ineffective institutions that 
  put citizens at risk of injury and death, yet the approved 2020 FY budget allocated 64% 
  of our Public Safety fund to the Albuquerque Police Department. To ensure your dedication 
  to our city and citizens, I demand that you defund the Albuquerque Police Department and 
  start providing more support and funding towards our community efforts and organizations 
  that serve our predominantly Latinx and Black communities, as these are the communities 
  that are being targeted the most. By doing so, I believe this will prevent further police
  brutality and violence in the future.\n\nThe Albuquerque Police Department states on the 
  cabq.gov website that “(they) help provide a safe and secure community where the rights, 
  history, and culture of all are respected!” If this true, we demand you listen to our concerns 
  and implement change. \n\nBlack and Latinx communities are living in persistent fear of being 
  killed by state authorities like police, immigration agents or even white vigilantes who are 
  emboldened by state actors. According to the Urban Institute, in 1977, state and local governments 
  spent $60 billion on police and corrections. In 2017, they spent $194 billion. A 220 
  percent increase. Despite continued profiling, harassment, terror and killing of 
  Black communities, local and federal decision-makers continue to invest in the police, 
  which leaves Black and Latinx people vulnerable and our communities no safer.\n\nWhere could 
  that money go? It could go towards building healthy communities, to the health of 
  our elders and children, to neighborhood infrastructure, to education, to childcare, 
  to support a vibrant Black and Latinx future. The possibilities are endless.\n\nWe join 
  in solidarity with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis, Louisville, and across the 
  United States. And we call for the end to police  terror.\n\nSincerely,\n[NAME]\n[PHONE_NUMBER]\n[EMAIL]\n[ADDRESS]\n"
