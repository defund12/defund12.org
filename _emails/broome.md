subject: Commit to Reallocation for Social Equity
body: |2+

  Dear Broome County Legislature,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [TOWN]. I am asking you to reallocate money away from the Broome County PD. Much scholarship shows that a living wage, access to health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at promoting community safety than policing and prisons. As such, I demand a meaningful reallocation of police department funds towards healthcare and social programs.

  Sincerely,
  [YOUR NAME]
  [YOUR ADDRESS]
  [YOUR EMAIL]
  [YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
