subject: I Want Justice  for the Murder of Breonna Taylor
body: "Dear Mayor Fischer,\n\nMy name is [NAME]. I am a resident of [CITY/NEIGHBORHOOD]
  and I am emailing today to demand accountability for the racist and brutal murder
  of Breonna Taylor.\n\nI demand that charges be pressed against all officers involved
  in this heinous crime and its coverup, especially John Mattingly, Brett Hankinson,
  and Myles Cosgrove. There have been no charges thus far and this is unacceptable.\n\nBreonna
  Taylor would be alive today if it was not for the gross abuse of power and negligence
  exhibited by the Louisville Metro Police Department; all officers involved must
  face consequences for this murder in order to provide her family with justice and
  prevent further cops from committing brutal acts of violence against our communities.\n\nWE
  DEMAND THE FOLLOWING OF OUR CITY:\n\n1. Mayor and City Council address the use of
  force by LMPD.\n\n2. Fire and revoke the pensions of the officers that murdered
  Breonna. Arrest, charge, and convict them for this crime. Ensure the newly requested
  special prosecutor, State AG Daniel Cameron, seeks full transparency and accountability.\n\n3.
  Provide all necessary information to a local, independent civilian community police
  accountability council #CPAC.\n\n4. Create policy for transparent investigation
  process due to law enforcement misconduct. \n\n5. Eliminate No Knock Warrants.\n\nSincerely,\n[NAME]\n[PHONE_NUMBER]\n[EMAIL]\n[ADDRESS]\n"
