subject: Decrease funding for police in the 2021 budget
body: "Dear City Councilors,\n \nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I'm a resident of Indianapolis.
  I am writing about the fiscal year 2021 budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis
  Marion County.\n\nMayor Hogsett claims to be \"dedicated to investing Indianapolis'
  resources back into our neighborhoods,\" yet the 2020 budget allocated $253 million
  or 31% of the total budget to the IMPD. By contrast, Neighborhood Services received
  funds amounting to 3% of the total budget, or less than a tenth of the IMPD budget.\n\nI
  am asking that the Indianapolis City Council push to make a more overt and visible
  commitment to the city and county's Black and Brown communities and to combat an
  over-investment in their criminalization and surveillance. I therefore demand that
  the Council find ways to redirect money away from the IMPD's overinflated budget.
  I urge you to pressure the mayor for an ethical and equal reallocation of the city's
  expenditures, away from the IMPD, and towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling
  of racial and class inequality.\n\nNow especially, the City Council can take a stand
  for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in Black and
  Brown communities insteadâ€”starting with education, housing, healthcare, cooperative
  businesses, community centers, and community-led organizations and projects.\n\nCan
  I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social services
  programs?\n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE
  NUMBER]\n"
