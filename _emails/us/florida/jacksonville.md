  Dear Jacksonville Mayor and City Coucil,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR DISTRICT]. I am a citizen who is disturbed by the injustices and brutality carried out by police forces across the country, and particularly in the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

  Racist police violence doesn’t just happen in other cities - it happens here in Jacksonville too. Our community has a long history of racist policy in housing and school segregation. Black citizens have been subjected to centuries of economic and social exclusion in Jacksonville. The current protests reflect concerned members of society taking direct, collective action to demand an end to the abuse and violence directed against Black people. These issues must become financial priorities so we can heal from our history. We want real change to be made to the way our city allocates its resources.

  I urge you to pressure the Mayor to redirect money towards an ethical reallocation of the City of Jacksonville’s expense budget, effective at the beginning of FY21. Commit to our city’s Black and Brown communities to combat an over-investment in their criminalization, surveillance, and discrimination. Now especially, the City Council can take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in Black and Brown communities. Provide relief to those in our community that are marginalized and victimized by the structural racism and inequity that Jacksonville was built upon, and that JSO is complicit in enforcing. Public tensions are rising and public opinion is dwindling in regard to the City’s inappropriate over-policed response to subsequent protests of police brutality and racism.

  Deprioritize JSO’s overinflated budget and meaningfully reallocate funds towards the following social services: Community Development, Affordable Housing Programs, Eviction Diversions, COVID Relief and Healthcare, Substance Abuse Treatment Services, Education, Childcare, Transportation, targeted support for marginalized communities and communities of color, Jobs, and Parks & Recreation. All of these sectors will facilitate the dismantling of racial and class inequality and will support racial and social justice, which will have both a short and long-term positive impact on our residents and their futures. This action will reflect the decades of research showing that social programs, education, and a living wage are far more successful at promoting the safety of a city than policing or prisons. We are overdue for change. Ending police brutality should be a budget priority. Justice should be a budget priority. Overpoliced communities are not safe communities. Thriving communities are safe communities, and communities thrive when they are well-resourced. We deserve a budget that divests from policing and jails and uses that money to invest in our communities. People are marching in the streets because they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to please listen to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action to address their concerns.

  JSO has been a waste of our resources. Last year, the JSO budget was $478,386,277, ($1,310,647.33 per day) almost all of which comes from taxes. This means the JSO budget was the single largest expenditure; higher than Fire and Rescue, Public Works, Parks and Recreation, Libraries, Neighborhoods, Planning and Development, Intra-Governmental Services, Finance, Special Services, Economic Development Office, Mayor’s Office, and our City Council budget combined. This isn’t how we create public safety. True public safety requires fully-funded and community-controlled resources, not more police and jails.

  JSO is overfunded and holds responsibility over community issues that they are fundamentally unable to address. We have seen mounting evidence that police departments are ineffective institutions that marginalize minority communities and put citizens at risk of injury and death. Our city needs EMTs, social workers, and other social service providers to respond to the majority of current police business, including health and wellness checks, domestic/sexual violence situations, and basic bureaucratic documentation around break-ins, vandalism, wrecks, etc. More often than not, when police are dispensed, rather than more qualified medical, psychiatric, and social work professionals, the effect is to bring violence where none previously existed. Jacksonville’s needs must be addressed by the provision of care, and not the threat of violence.

  JSO offers “unlimited overtime pay for all” through Operation Safe and Sound, which, more often than not, is paid out to officers responsible for harassing the unhoused, and Black, Indigenous, people of color.

  We don’t need a militarized police force. Divest from offensive weapons. Offensive weapons are known to escalate violence, especially when deployed in situations where none existed before. Almost all the current litany of Black men and women dead from police violence were non-violent, unarmed people, for whom armed police became the site of death and brutality. If you want to promote community safety, dedicate yourselves fully to ending poverty– don’t give the police force another $478 million+ to spend on riot gear, grenades, and chemical weapons like tear gas (which is considered a war crime to use according to 1925 Geneva protocol) to use against your own city.
  
  History has shown that police “reform” will not be enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.

  Do not forget our poor communities and communities of color who are disproportionate targets of police violence. Our violent police department is, quite frankly, upholding policies and practices that allow white supremacy to take Black lives every single day.

  As the City Council, the budget proposal is in your hands. It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Public opinion is with me. We can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change. Now is a chance for Jacksonville to lead the country and show how demilitarization and defunding the police can create a safer city for all of us.

  Mayor Curry, will you look out for me, and will you look out for us? Can I count on you to pass an alternative budget that puts a focus on social service programs?

  Thank you for your time,
