  Dear Mayor Dailey and Tallahassee City Commissioners,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I request that the Mayor and City Commission support our community and hear our call for:

  - Efforts to defund and de-escalate the police department, and to reallocate money to programs and city-led initiatives that support education, rehabilitation, public health, and community-oriented activities.

  - Rejection of expanded and militarized police budgets.

  - Efforts to improve oversight and independent investigations to hold individual law enforcement officers and police departments accountable for misconduct.

  - Redirection of money away from the Tallahassee PD, and into Community Development, Public Transportation, Education, Parks & Recreation, as well as targeted support for marginalized communities.

  I have noticed that in the FY20 approved budget the police department's budget is over $59 million. That is over twice the amount for parks and recreation, and, critically, nearly three times the amount for StarMetro Operating Fund. In light of recent events, I believe it is critical that policing be deprioritized relative to spending on social programs that are actually proven to promote safe and equitable communities.

  I request that an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect in order to reallocate these funds to resources that community members can benefit from.

  Thank you for your time,
