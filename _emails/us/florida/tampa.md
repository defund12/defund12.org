  Dear Mayor Jane Castor & Tampa City Council,

  My name is [INSERT NAME] and I am a resident of [INSERT NEIGHBORHOOD, SUBDIVISION, CITY, ETC], today I am writing to you to demand that the mayor and the city council adopt a smaller budget for the police department that lends more towards community programs and outreach to keep our community safe. Programs such as housing, education, jobs and healthcare.

  The recommended police department budget for 2020 according to the publicly released budget expense report came in at over $162,000,000. This is an astronomical number alone and as well when compared to the budgets of other departments. This budget should have been reallocated and reinvested in the community rather than the militarized police force we have seen clashing with peaceful protestors.

  I demand that the City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Tampa Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Tampa residents.

  I call on City Council as well as the mayor to slash this budget, invest in the citizens of Tampa, and set an example for the Tampa Bay area and for the nation as a whole. With these initiatives, we can lead the nation in a new way that's been previously unimagined.

  Can I count on you to reallocate and reinvest these funds? If not, you can count on me to make sure you are voted out.

  Sincerely,

  [YOUR NAME]
  [YOUR ADDRESS]
