body: "Dear Mayor Pam and Chapel Hill Town Council,\n\nI am asking you all to actively
  defund the police, to clarify how much Town Council plans to defund the police in
  advance of the Public Hearing on June 10, and provide evidence of how the initiatives
  discussed by Mayor Pam \"yielded positive results,\" with statistical or testimonial
  breakdowns by race or ethnicity. \n\nAs a resident of Chapel Hill, I am calling
  you to actively defund the police and limit its reach into our communities, especially
  those of Black and ethnic minorities. The \"slight\" cuts mentioned by Mayor Pam,
  which were already anticipated due to Covid-19, undermines global outcries to actively
  and intentionally limit the funding of programs that inadvertently promote police
  brutality, violence, and discrimination. Many of the policies Mayor Pam listed actually
  work to extend the reach of police violence and discrimination under the guise of
  progress. I am worried about these initiatives given what I am seeing every day.
  Who exactly is benefiting and who is being harmed? For example, the Good Neighbor
  Initiative in Northside, a historically Black community, deserves close scrutiny
  since it can enable the internal bias and target Black residents when a noise complaint
  can lead to a court fee, criminal charge, arrest, or murder.\n\nCouncil must act
  and be proactive to redistribute funds away from the police. Although cities and
  towns across the country have implemented many of the 8cantwait policies mentioned
  by Mayor Pam, these same cities and towns regularly see the murder and discrimination
  of Black and minority ethnicities. The 8cantwait policies are not what I am calling
  for. Rather, the most direct way to avoid police brutality and discrimination is
  to significantly shift the budget away from the Chapel Hill Police Department.\n\nI
  call on Chapel Hill Town Council to take the following actions:\n\n  1. Redirect
  funds divested from policing to provide educational opportunities, youth programs,
  environmental justice initiatives, mental health resources, agricultural and food-based
  inequality programs, sexual assault services, and social work services to our communities.\n\n
  \ 2. Ensure that Covid-19 budget cuts do not affect important community programs
  but the budget rather be drawn from the Chapel Hill Police Department\n\n  3. Commit
  resources to support community-led alternatives to policing, such as social work
  programs.\n\n  4. Propose plans for ensuring the safety of Black and other marginalized
  people in our community from racial profiling by police and other security forces
  with input from members of the marginalized communities themselves.\n  \nIf Council
  members in larger cities, such as Minneapolis, Saint Paul, New York, and Los Angeles,
  are actively working to limit community ties with the police and implement defunding
  strategies, I am optimistic that the town of Chapel Hill can do the same. I am urging
  you, Chapel Hill Town Council, to adopt a budget that defunds the police and funds
  non-violent, community-led, health, and safety strategies. This is a time that will
  be stamped in public memory, where residents can say whether our Town Council members
  did or did not actively engage to significantly defund the police.\n\nSincerely,
  \n[YOUR NAME] \n"
