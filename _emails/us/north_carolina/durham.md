subject: Defund the Durham Police & Reallocate Funds
body: "Dear Mayor Schewel & City Council Members:\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME]. I am
  a resident of Durham. I am writing to object to the allocation of over $70M to the
  Durham Police Department in the 2020-2021 city budget. It is indefensible to increase
  the police budget when city workers are experiencing layoffs and denial of wage
  increases, and thousands of our community members face unemployment and housing/food
  insecurity in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe police cannot protect us
  from these challenges. In fact, more often than not, when police are dispensed,
  rather than more qualified medical, psychiatric, and social work professionals,
  the effect is to bring violence where none previously existed. Moreover, to paraphrase
  an existing council member, it is not cities with the most police, but the most
  resources, that are the safest.  To that end, I make a two-fold request to the council:\n\nReallocate
  all proposed increases in police budget to Durham Public Schools, affordable housing
  and rent subsidies, eviction diversions, food resources, and medical supplies, which
  have both immediate and longstanding consequences that will more positively affect
  our current residents.\nImplement a plan to reallocate existing police resources
  to institutions and experts better equipped to deal with many of the issues DPD
  have been conscripted, without adequate training, to do. Resources should be allocated
  to EMTs, social workers, and other social service providers to respond to the majority
  of current police business, including health and wellness checks, domestic/sexual
  violence situations, and basic bureaucratic documentation around break-ins, vandalism,
  wrecks, etc. Additional money should go to community education around de-escalation
  and community support for drug, SV/DV, and property-related incidents. There is
  no reason to have armed officers responding to the majority of emergency needs in
  Durham.\n\nFinally, I request that you divest from offensive weapons. Offensive
  weapons are known to escalate violence, especially when deployed in situations where
  none existed before. Almost all the current litany of Black men and women dead from
  police violence were non-violent, unarmed people, for whom armed police became the
  site of death and brutality. \n\nCan I count on you to consider an alternative budget
  that puts a focus on social service programs?\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR
  ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
