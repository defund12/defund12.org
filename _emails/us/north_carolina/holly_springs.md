subject: Decrease funding for the Holly Springs police department
body: "Dear Mayor Sears and Town Council,\n\nMy name is [NAME] and I am a resident
  of Holly Springs. I urge you to amend the proposed budget for 2021. I would like
  to redirect money away from Holly Springs Police Department and into social service
  programs that will benefit public health and our own community directly, especially
  communities of color. \n\nThe proposed budget for 2021 suggests that the largest
  fraction of the town's budget should go to policing ($7,861,585), which is nearly
  30% larger than even the second largest allocation of funds, parks and recreation
  ($6,082,691). The recommended budget for FY20-21 suggests that 25% of the general
  fund changes should go to a \"Safe and Friendly\" priority area   while only 2%
  should go to \"Economic Prosperity and Diversity\" and an \"Engaged, Healthy, and
  Active Community,\" respectively. You must consider that economic prosperity and
  diversity, as well as public health in general, have so much more to do with the
  safety of a community than does a police force, especially as we see our nation
  reel and ache over the unjust murder of George Floyd and countless other black Americans
  at the hands of police forces, not to mention the police brutality that has   ensued
  as a direct result of protests against police brutality. Holly Springs already applauds
  itself for being the \"#1 Safest City in North Carolina.\" We do not need to spend
  so much on policing.\n\n\"Crime\" is not random. What is presented to us as \"crime\"
  usually happens when someone has been unable to meet their basic needs, or when
  policing is arbitrarily applied to nonviolent actors--disproportionately Black and
  Brown people. So, to really “fight crime,” we don’t need more police officers -
  we need more jobs, more educational opportunities, more arts programs, more community
  centers, more mental health resources, as well as more of a say in how our own communities
  function. This is a long transition process but change starts with reallocating
  this funding!\n\nWe don’t need an overinflated police force. We need to create a
  community in which more mental health service providers, social workers, victim/survivor
  advocates, religious leaders, neighbors, and friends can look out for one another.
  Mayor Sears, will you look out for me, and will you look out for us?\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
