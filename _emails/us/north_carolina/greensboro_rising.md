body: "Dear Mayor Vaughan & City Council Members,\n \nMy name is [YOUR NAME]. I am
  a resident of [DISTRICT/NEIGHBORHOOD]. The police are killing Black people. They
  choke us to death like George Floyd in Minneapolis and Marcus Deon Smith in Greensboro.
  They invade our privacy and search us with no reason, like a 15-year-old boy who
  was stopped while running on the Greenway a week after Ahmaud Arbery was shot for
  running while Black. They arrest us for things that are legal for white people.
  We smoke weed at the same rates as white people and are 80% of the people who are
  arrested for marijuana. We are only 44% of the City.\n \nWe need to stop spending
  money on policing and harm. We need to start spending money on schools, teachers,
  guidance counselors, affordable housing, healthcare, childcare, livable wages, resources
  for domestic and sexual violence survivors, and everything that will help our communities
  thrive. Everything cannot be fixed overnight, and we need to change at every level
  of government. But there are things the Greensboro City Council has the power to
  do right now. And if they fail to act, we will need a new City Council. The City
  Council must use their power to pass ordinances instead of relying on the police
  to make temporary administrative changes. We  demand that the Greensboro City Council
  immediately:\n \nMake amends to the family of Marcus Smith, an unarmed man experiencing
  homelessness who Greensboro police hogtied and killed in the street.\n \nEnd the
  curfew and stop physically harming and arresting people who are not physically harming
  others.\n \nDefund the police, so they cannot buy militarized weapons to harm us.
  Fund Crisis Intervention and Recreation Centers.\n \nStop the police from being
  violent with us.\n \nTreat trans and gender non-conforming, intersex and other LGBTQ
  people with dignity.\n\nTreat people experiencing homelessness with dignity and
  stop criminalizing them.\n\nEnd arrests for marijuana.\n \nPublicly share data so
  we can understand how the police are treating us.\n\nMake the police get our signed
  permission before searching us without a warrant.\n \nAllow the Police Community
  Review Board to hold the police accountable.\n\nFor a closer look at our demands,
  please see:\nhttps://greensbororising.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/greensboro-risings-demands-to-the-city-of-greensboro/\n\nThank
  you, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
