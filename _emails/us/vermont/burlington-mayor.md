  Dear Mayor Weinberger and City Councilmembers,

  My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am a resident of Burlington and I am writing today to demand that you take specific measures to reduce funding for police in the City of Burlington. I call on you to take a serious look at the amount of funding being designated towards criminalization and surveillance. You have a responsibility to address the cityâ€™s lack of investment in predominantly Black and Brown communities.

  The City of Burlington is looking at increasing the budget of the Police Department by $17.4 million this year, as you well know. Spending for immigrant services, disability services, education, housing, and youth and family services pale in comparison to this excessive budget.

  Burlington can take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in Black and Brown communities, starting with cutting the least transparent and most harmful parts of the BPD budget.

  As elected officials, you must show strength in your role as a leader of the Council, and take a stand for defunding the BPD. We the residents of Burlington will hold you accountable for swift and just action.

  Sincerely,

  [YOUR NAME]
  [YOUR ADDRESS]
  [YOUR EMAIL]
  [YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
