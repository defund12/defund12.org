body: "Dear Arlington County Board,\n\nOn behalf of Arlington for Justice, we are
  writing to share our concerns about the role of the Arlington County Police Department,
  especially its recent actions on June 1, 2020 to remove nonviolent protesters who
  were lawfully protesting in DC, and our recommendations for reform.\n\nAs Arlingtonians,
  we have protested, marched and held vigils to raise our concerns over the recent
  police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and the hundreds of police killings
  all over the country for decades. We condemn these police murders and acts of violence.\n\nIt
  is with this backdrop that we were especially distressed to learn of Arlington County
  Police Department’s involvement in removing people from Lafayette Park in Washington,
  DC on June 1, 2020 as reported in The Washington Post and other news outlets. These
  individuals were exercising their First Amendment rights and lawfully protesting
  against police brutality. We were surprised to learn that Arlington’s police officers
  were part of an effort to squash the constitutional rights and limit the voices
  of dissent against the federal government.\n\nWe are outraged by our police department’s
  action. It raises serious questions about the use of mutual aid agreements, and
  more fundamentally, about the role of law enforcement in our community and how resources
  are allocated to meet the most basic needs of residents in our community.\n\nWe
  urge you to adopt these recommendations:\n\n(1) Leadership\nWe understand that Arlington
  Police Chief Farr will be retiring from his position at the end of 2020. This provides
  an opportunity to reconsider the police chief’s role. We urge you to:\n● Conduct
  a nationwide search with an emphasis on finding a police chief who is committed
  to justice system transformation, eliminating bias, and implementing new methods
  of policing.\n\n(2) Revamped Role\nWe expect that you will engage the community
  and its stakeholders in deciding the future role of our police force to ensure that
  it is attuned to community needs. Towards that end, we urge you to:\n● Eliminate
  the School Resource Officers Unit in the Arlington County Police Department.\n●
  Reduce over-reliance on policing by establishing alternatives to calling the police
  & educational efforts and alternative approaches to responding to mental health
  crises.\n● End policing of minor offenses that do not threaten public safety, such
  as fare evasion, possession of marijuana, and driving with a suspended driver’s
  licence.\n● Repeal the ordinance that criminalizes failing to identify oneself to
  a law enforcement office (Arlington Code 17-13(c).\n● Establish enforceable protections
  against racial profiling to prevent police from intervening in community members’
  lives and reduce over-policing in Arlington communities.\n● End Arlington law enforcement’s
  participation in the federal 1033 Program that provides military weaponry to local
  law enforcement.\n● End mutual aid agreements with federal agencies such as the
  Park Police, the National Guard and ICE.\n\n(3) Invest in community over law enforcement
  by reallocating resources\nAs the police budget has increased by 35% in the last
  decade, we recommend that you:\n● Reallocate funding from eliminating the School
  Resources Officers Unit to fund more school social workers and school psychologists.\n●
  Reallocate at least 10% of Arlington County’s Police Department’s $74 million per
  year budget.\n● Freeze increases for Arlington County Police Department for the
  next five years.\n● Reallocate the resources from these budget revisions through
  a participatory budget process that would allow Arlington’s residents, especially
  communities most impacted by the criminal justice system, to democratically decide
  how to allocate funds towards services and programs, such as:\n○ Alternatives to
  calling the police\n○ Pre-arrest diversion programs\n○ Health care services\n○ Substance
  abuse and drug and alcohol addiction treatment\n○ Mental health care services\n\n(4)
  Oversight\nTo expand oversight of our police force, we ask that you:\n● Create a
  Community Review Oversight Board with subpoena power and a Community Complaints
  Office.\n● Remove barriers to reporting police misconduct.\n● For all stops by a
  police officer, require officers to give community members their name, badge number,
  reason for the stop and a card with instructions for filing a complaint to the Community
  Review Oversight Board.\n\n(5) Policy and Practice Reforms\nTo expand best practices
  and reduce disparities, we urge you to:\n● Conduct a comprehensive review of Arlington
  County Police Department’s “use of force” policy and update it by September, 2020
  to ensure that it aligns with best practices, including banning knee holds (See
  Campaign Zero model use of force policy).\n● Ensure that dash cameras are installed
  and properly functioning in all police vehicles, and that police vehicles are not
  utilized when the camera is not properly functioning.\n● Immediately require Arlington
  County Police Officers to wear body cameras and establish effective policies governing
  their use (See ACLU Model Policy) as well as penalties for individual officers who
  turn off their camera.\n● Consider & undertake additional practice and policy reforms
  such as in the extensive recommendations in this report from national civil rights
  leaders: https://civilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Policing_Full_Report.pdf\n\n(6)
  Recruitment and Staffing\nTo increase the number of police officers who reflect
  the neighborhoods they serve in our community, we recommend that you:\n● Develop
  and publicly report a plan by 2021 with strategies such as providing housing assistance.\n●
  Expand successful community policing strategies in the Green Valley community throughout
  Arlington.\n\n(7) Accountability\nTo ensure more accountability in our police force,
  we urge you to:\n● Make officers' disciplinary history publicly accessible.\n● Hold
  police officers who kill or seriously injure community members financially accountable.\n●
  Update the community feedback survey to allow input on residents’ experiences and
  perceptions of our police department. This input should be used to inform the department's
  policies, practices, evaluations, and pay incentives.\n\n(8) Transparency\nTo increase
  transparency, we ask that you:\n● Increase data collection and public reporting
  to include the race and ethnicity of everyone involved in any interactions with
  Arlington County Police Department officers.\n\n(9) Justice Transformation Commission\nTo
  ensure that these recommendations are fully implemented and Arlington residents
  are involved in our justice system transformation, we urge that you:\n● Immediately
  establish a Justice Transformation Commission with Arlington County public officials
  and community members together appointed to serve for the next six months to manage
  the implementation of these recommendations. The commission would:\n○ Meet every
  two weeks at locations accessible to the public\n○ Include time for public testimony\n○
  Host public hearings so that you can hear from Arlington residents on how to effectively
  implement these recommendations\n○ Write & release a report with recommendations
  on the timing of implementation of these recommendations\nThank you for your time
  and consideration. We look forward to seeing your response to our recommendations
  and to working with you on these critical issues. "
