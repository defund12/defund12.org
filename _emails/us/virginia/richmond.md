subject: Reallocation of RPD Budget
body: "My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Richmond. This past week, our
  nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful reevaluation
  of the role of policing in our communities and an end to racism and anti-Blackness.
  Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come
  to my attention that the budget for 2021 is being decided as these protests continue.\n\nRPD
  has been a waste of our resources. Last year, the RPD’s total general fund was $95,403,743
  while Housing and Community Development’s was $3,296,705. While we’ve been spending
  extraordinary amounts on policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness,
  mental health, or affordability in our city. Instead, we see wasteful and harmful
  actions of our police.\n\nI call on you to meaningfully restrict the RPD budget
  and instead use those extraordinary resources towards solving homelessness, which
  is felt most by our Black neighbors and veterans. Social programs and education
  generally have been shown to be much more effective at promoting safety and social
  equity than policing and incarceration.\n\nWe can be a beacon for other cities to
  follow if only we have the courage to change. Can I count on you to consider an
  alternative budget that puts a focus on social service programs?\n\nSincerely,  \n\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
