body: "Dear Mayor White, Greenville City Council, and County Councilmembers\n\nMy
  name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of [YOUR DISTRICT/NEIGHBORHOOD].\n\nI am
  asking that you reallocate funds from overinflated Greenville policing budgets and
  invest them into social services that would directly improve the well-being of Greenville
  residents. The two year budget for the Sheriff’s Office for the 2020-2021 fiscal
  year is $96,307,964. This is a 6% increase in the budget from the FY2018-2019 budget.
  The largest budget enhancement of the 2020-2021 budget is the addition of fourteen
  deputies in 2020 and fourteen deputies in 2021- eight more total than the Sheriff
  requested. The 2020 Greenville city budget allocated fully 1/3 of the general fund
  to policing, vastly more than any social services. \n\nResearch shows that social
  spending--on housing, education, health--is much more effective at promoting safe
  communities than policing. An armed response to every problem in our community is
  inappropriate and puts residents in danger.\n\nI am requesting that budget votes
  be delayed and an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect
  in order to deny/revise the proposed budgets.\n\nI am demanding long term and sustainable
  change. I am demanding that the budgets for Greenville city and county be better
  spent on quality of life for all. In particular for those in our Black and Brown
  communities, who are more than likely to be directly affected by police brutality
  and violence. Programs that support education, housing, healthcare, and community
  centers deserve our prioritization.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
