  Dear Mayor White and Greenville County Council Members,

  My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Greenville County.

  I am demanding you reallocate funds from the Greenville County Police department and invest them into social services that would directly improve the well-being of Greenville County citizens. The two year budget for the Sheriffâ€™s Office for the 2020-2021 fiscal year is $96,307,964. This is a 6% increase in the budget from the 2018-2019 fiscal year. The largest budget enhancement of the 2020-2021 budget is the addition of fourteen deputies in 2020 and fourteen deputies in 2021- eight more total than the Sheriff requested.

  I am also requesting that the budget vote be delayed and an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect in order to deny/revise the proposed budget.

  There is research to support that affordable housing, educational opportunities, and community outreach programs are more successful at promoting safe and stable communities than law enforcement.

  I am demanding long term and sustainable change. I am demanding that the city of Greenville's budget be better spent on quality of life for all. In particular for those in our Black and Brown communities, who are more than likely to be directly affected by police brutality and violence. Programs that support education, housing, healthcare, and community centers deserve our attention and funding.

  Thank you,
