  Dear City Council Members & Leaders,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of Santa Fe. I first want to thank you for your work, energy and service for our city. As a resident here, I deeply appreciate and am grateful for your service and all the energy your pour into keeping our community.

  Accordingly, it has come to my attention that budget for 2021 will be submitted on July 31, and hearings will begin on July 13. As a representative of my voice, I ask you to please vote no at on any resolution to approve the Santa Fe County Five Year Capital Plan Fixed Assets Summary so long as it includes any expenditures for rifles, tasers, and SWAT equipment.

  I am deeply concerned about the weaponization of our police force and using these weapons against your own citizens&#151;the very ones who you are here to be of service to. As a community member, the presence of weapons does not help me feel safe and in fact elicits an opposite impact and does not promote community safety.

  I cannot understand or approve this choice and use of our city's funds. As such please divest the $88,000 allocated toward the purchase of weapons including 20 AR-15 rifles, 500 tasers, and SWAT helmet video cameras for the Sheriff's Department. I urge you to instead advocate for a meaningful reallocation of the city's expenditures: away from policing, and towards social programs and resources that support housing, jobs, education, health care, child care, and other critical community needs.

  Thank you for listening and honoring my voice so it may translate into action and change.

  Sincerely,

  [YOUR NAME]
