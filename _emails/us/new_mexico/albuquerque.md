body: "\nHello,\n\nMy name is [NAME]. I am a resident of [CITY/NEIGHBORHOOD], and
  I am emailing today to demand an overhaul to our Albuquerque Police Department budget
  in light of the Black Lives Matter protests across the US, but specifically in Albuquerque.
  \n\nWE ARE JOINING TOGETHER TO DEMAND THAT YOU, MY LOCAL OFFICIALS, WILL: \n\n1.
  Vote no on all increases to police budgets; \n2. Vote yes to decrease police spending
  and budgets; \n3. Vote yes to increase spending on healthcare, education, housing,
  and community programs that keep us safe.\n\nThe militarized tactics that police
  departments are using against citizens is unacceptable and unwarranted. We have
  seen mounting evidence that police departments are racist and ineffective institutions
  that put citizens at risk of injury and death, yet the approved 2020 FY budget allocated
  64% of our Public Safety fund to the Albuquerque Police Department. To ensure your
  dedication to our city and citizens, I demand that you defund the Albuquerque Police
  Department and start providing more support and funding towards our community efforts
  and organizations that serve our predominantly Black and Latinx communities, as
  these are the communities that are being targeted the most. By doing so, I believe
  this will prevent further police brutality and violence in the future.\n\nThe Albuquerque
  Police Department states on the cabq.gov website that “(they) help provide a safe
  and secure community where the rights, history, and culture of all are respected!”
  If this true, we demand you listen to our concerns and implement change. \n\nBlack
  and Latinx communities are living in persistent fear of being killed by state authorities
  like police, immigration agents or even white vigilantes who are emboldened by state
  actors. According to the Urban Institute, in 1977, state and local governments spent
  $60 billion on police and corrections. In 2017, they spent $194 billion. A 220 percent
  increase. Despite continued profiling, harassment, terror and killing of Black communities,
  local and federal decision-makers continue to invest in the police, which leaves
  Black and Latinx people vulnerable and our communities no safer.\n\nWhere could
  that money go? It could go towards building healthy communities, to the health of
  our elders and children, to neighborhood infrastructure, to education, to childcare,
  to support a vibrant Black and Latinx future. The possibilities are endless.\n\nWe
  join in solidarity with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis, Louisville, and across
  the United States. And we call for the end to police  terror.\n\nSincerely,\n[NAME]\n[PHONE_NUMBER]\n[EMAIL]\n[ADDRESS]\n"
