body: "Dear Mayor Miyagishima and the Las Cruces City Council,\n\nMy name is [NAME].
  I am a resident of [CITY/NEIGHBORHOOD], and I am emailing today to demand an overhaul
  to our Las Cruces Police Department budget in light of the Black Lives Matter protests
  across the US, but specifically in Las Cruces.\n\nI AM DEMANDING THAT YOU, MY LOCAL
  OFFICIALS, WILL:\n-Vote no on all increases to police budgets.\n-Vote yes to decrease
  police spending and budgets.\n-Vote yes to increase spending on healthcare, education,
  housing, and community programs that keep us safe.\n\nThe militarized tactics that
  police departments are using against citizens is unacceptable and unwarranted. We
  have seen mounting evidence that police departments are racist and ineffective institutions
  that put citizens at risk of injury and death. This is amply demonstrated by the
  recent killing of Antonio Valenzuela in Las Cruces Police custody using a banned
  “vascular neck restraint\"—the same restraint used to kill George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nThe
  approved FY2020 budget allocated over 61% of our Public Safety fund to the Las Cruces
  Police Department. To ensure your dedication to our city and citizens, I demand
  that you defund the Las Cruces Police Department and start providing more support
  and funding towards community-based safety and social programs. This reprioritization
  will be necessary to prevent further police brutality and violence in the future,
  and finally mark a turn from overpolicing and incarceration. \n\nBlack, Latinx,
  and Indigenous communities are living in persistent fear of being killed by state
  authorities like police, immigration agents or even white vigilantes who are emboldened
  by state actors. According to the Urban Institute, in 1977, state and local governments
  spent $60 billion on police and corrections. In 2017, they spent $194 billion—a
  220 percent increase. Despite continued police profiling, harassment, terror and
  killing in Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, local and federal decision-makers
  continue to invest in the police, which leaves these communities vulnerable and
  our communities no safer.\n\nWhere could reallocated money go? It could go towards
  building healthy communities, to the health of our elders and children, to neighborhood
  infrastructure, to education, to childcare, to support vibrant Black, Latinx, and
  Indigenous futures. The possibilities are incredibly exciting.\n\nWe join in solidarity
  with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis, Louisville, and across the United States.
  And we call for the end to police terror.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
