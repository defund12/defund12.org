body: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of Columbia's [YOUR COUNCIL WARD].
  I am asking you to redirect money away from the Columbia PD and into the public
  services such as housing, education, and healthcare access, and to consider direct
  financial relief to citizens (not just businesses) impacted by COVID-19. \n\nAs
  it stands, our city is facing massive revenue shortfalls due to conditions created
  by the Covid-19 Pandemic. Rather than see further reduction to public services and
  layoffs of essential public workers, I request that the mayor and city council first
  and foremost consider significantly defunding the police department. In the FY21
  budget, there was an increase to both police personnel and corrections spending.
  This money can be spent in other ways that are proven to be more effective in improving
  community safety and wellness. \n\nThank you for your time, \n\n[YOUR NAME] \n\n[YOUR
  ADDRESS] \n\n[YOUR EMAIL] \n\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
