body: "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY].\n\nThe
  City of Cleveland needs to address the lack of investment in predominantly Black
  communities and the over-investment in their criminalization. Although the 2020
  city budget was already approved in March, the City of Cleveland must reduce its
  Division of Police budget.\n\n$217,908,375 of the $1.8 billion budget is allocated
  to the Division of Police, an increase of $10 million from 2019. That increase is
  greater than the entire 2020 Department of Housing budget. \n\nAfter a two year
  investigation ending in 2014, the Justice Department cited CPD for abuse due to
  a pattern and practice of excessive force. Ohioans understand this resulted in a
  consent decree that mandates certain budget allocations. Ohioans also expect and
  deserve compliance and progress with the consent decree. In April 2020, Desmond
  Franklin was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer. In December 2019, 13-year-old
  Tamia Chappman was killed in a high-speed police chase while walking to the library.
  We cannot rely on the Division of Police to “self-evaluate in order to improve in
  areas of training, efficient and effective delivery of services, officer safety,
  and community engagement” in the best interest of the public, like the staffing
  report claims.\n\nMayor Frank Jackson is complicit in the crisis of police brutality.
  Tragic killings of Black Cleveland citizens by police violence — including Timothy
  Russell, Malissa Williams, and Tamir Rice — happened under Mayor Jackson’s tenure.
  \n\nIn an interview with The Appeal on June 3 2020, Mayor Jackson said: \na) he
  would not revisit reallocating police budget now \nb) Cleveland cannot rely on the
  government to help end structural racism and police violence and we should instead
  look to philanthropy and the private sector.\n…If not now, when? If government can’t
  help fix itself, who can? The burden does not lie on citizens. I demand you reconsider
  these stances to help end, not mitigate, police brutality.\n\nCleveland City Council
  cares about these issues. The recent unanimous vote to declare racism a public health
  crisis proves that. I ask that you continue to find sustainable, long-term change
  for the entire community. \n\nResearch shows that a living wage, access to holistic
  health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far
  more successful at reducing crime than police or prisons. Redirect money from the
  Division of Police and instead invest in social services. The policing budget can
  be better spent on quality of life for all, particularly in predominantly Black
  and brown communities. Programs like education, housing, healthcare, cooperative
  businesses, and community centers deserve that funding. \n\nThank you.\n"
