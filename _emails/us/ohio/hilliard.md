body: "Dear Hilliard Council Members,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident
  of Hilliard, Ohio. I’m sure you’ve seen the widespread protests across our country,
  attempting to combat police brutality and state funded violence that disproportionately
  effects minority communities. Too often, this violence takes the lives of members
  of our community--physically in the form of death, or otherwise making people scared
  to participate in their own lives, on their own terms. It is horrifying to me that
  we have allowed this culture of fear to persist for so long. Police in Ohio’s capital,
  Columbus, have recently killed a woman who was protesting peacefully, when she inhaled
  the copious amount of pepper spray they discharged upon protesters, and died. I’m
  sure you’ve also heard of other protesters losing eyes to rubber bullets, or being
  maimed by gas canisters or stun grenades. \n\nPolicing is far from the only way
  to promote safety in the community. In fact, it is irresponsible to put so much
  responsibility on someone who has likely only had a few months of training. Most
  problems do not call for an armed response; they need someone to help with the complicated
  roots of the issues that often land people in frightening situations. After all,
  if the only tool you have is a hammer, every obstacle will look like a nail. This
  is why I’m calling for you to defund the police. We need to shift our focus away
  from policing, and put more money and more effort into services that will help the
  community without using violence, especially paying attention to preventative measures
  to keep our community safe. We need to put more into resources that support education,
  health care, therapy, child care, helping the unemployed, housing, and other needs
  that are integral to live a full and happy life. Our community will be supported
  by these programs in a way that policing fundamentally cannot address.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
