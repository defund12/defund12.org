body: "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. \n\nThe City
  of Toledo must do better by all of its residents. The current city budget affords
  the criminalization of Black communities while offering very little investment in
  them. In order for Toledo to be a more equitable city, I call on our leaders to
  reduce police spending for the 2021 fiscal year. \n\nIn the 2020 budget for “basic
  services,” the police department receives $91,859,538 of $251,227,767 - more than
  a third of the budget. In the past three years alone, police spending has increased
  by $10 million. Consider what that $10 million could accomplish in three years if
  used to invest in communities instead of police them. \n\nWe all share the same
  goals for racial justice and equity. On June 5th, Mayor Kapszukiewicz said, “I believe
  that now is the time to bring change to police-community relations.” He’s right
  - now is definitely the time. Let’s take action and bring meaningful change by divesting
  from the police. \n\nToledo’s leaders and residents have the opportunity to create
  a more equitable city for all of us and correct what decades of neglect and destructive
  policing have done to underserved Black communities. I urge you to have the moral
  clarity to create a budget focused on building communities and creating positive
  change instead of investing in a racist and destructive institution. \n\nThank you,\n\n[NAME]"
