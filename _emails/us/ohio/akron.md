  "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/WARD].

  The City of Akron must do better by its residents. I am urging you to divest from the criminalization of our communities and reduce police spending in the budget for the 2021 fiscal year. In May, Mayor Horrigan warned of deep spending cuts due to the pandemic. It is time to cut funding for the Akron Police Department.

  In the 2020 budget, police receive $59,147,850 out of a total $173,128,930. This is 34% – over a third – of the overall budget.

  I know many of you feel strongly about racial justice and equity. On June 4, Mayor Horrigan said the City is working on a “culture of outreach, compliance, transparency, and inclusion.” It is time to take action.

  Individual solutions will not fix systemic problems. It is time for Akron, its leaders, and residents to create a more equitable city for all of us. Have the moral clarity to create a budget focused on communities instead of investing in a racist and destructive institution. Defund the Akron Police Department.

  Thank you,
  [NAME]"
