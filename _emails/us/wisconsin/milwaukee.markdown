subject: Defund MPD, Reallocate for Social Equity
body: "Dear Milwaukee Council Members,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident
  of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY].\n\nI am extremely concerned with the City of Milwaukee’s
  inordinate investment in the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) at the expense of
  critical youth, education, and health services.\n\nI am asking that the Milwaukee
  Common Council make a more overt and visible commitment to racial justice. I ask
  that the budget vote be delayed so that Council may find ways to redirect money
  away from Milwaukee Police Department’s overinflated budget. I urge you to pressure
  the City Manager’s Office for an ethical reallocation of the city’s expenditures:
  away from MPD, and towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and
  class inequality.\n\nResearch shows that a living wage, access to health services
  and treatment, educational opportunities, and stable housing are far more successful
  at promoting safe communities than police or prisons. As such, I demand more aggressive
  financial support be directed to those areas.\n\nThe events of the last weeks have
  shown time and again that it is also critical that you implement enforceable controls
  on police tactics, and explicitly ban pervasive violent tactics--dangerous physical
  restraints, chemical weapons, and rubber bullets are all seriously dangerous and
  often lethal. \n\nPeople are marching in the streets because they know that these
  actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to please listen
  to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action to address their concerns.\n\nCan
  I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social service
  programs?\n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE
  NUMBER]"
