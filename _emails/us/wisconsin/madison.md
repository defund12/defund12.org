subject: Reallocation of Funds from MPD to Social Service Programs
body: "Dear Madison Council Members and Alderpersons,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and
  I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY].\n\nI am extremely concerned with the City
  of Madison's inordinate investment in the Madison Police Department (MPD) at the
  expense of critical youth, education, and health services.\n\nI am asking that the
  Madison Common Council make a more overt and visible commitment to racial justice.
  I demand that the budget vote be delayed so that the Council may find ways to redirect
  money away from Madison Police Department’s overinflated budget. I urge you to pressure
  the City Manager’s Office towards an ethical and equal reallocation of the city’s
  expenditures, away from MPD, and towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling
  of racial and class inequality. \n\nResearch shows that a living wage, access to
  holistic health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing
  are far more successful at reducing crime than police or prisons. As such, I demand
  more aggressive financial support be directed to those areas.\n\nI also urge the
  Madison Common Council to enact legislation that holds police accountable and to
  overturn policies that allow police to engage in unlawful behavior with impunity.
  These \nsteps to reform the police department are also necessary now but true justice
  will only occur when the police are defunded. \n\nPeople are marching in the streets
  because they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society.
  I implore you to please listen to the needs of your constituents and take immediate
  action to address their concerns.\n\nCan I count on you to consider an alternative
  budget that puts a focus on social service programs?\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
