body: "Dear Mayor Carter and St. Paul City Council,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME], and
  I am a resident of [YOUR CITY, STATE]. I stand in solidarity with protesters across
  the country who are out in the streets in response to the horrific murders of George
  Floyd, a Black man, by the Minneapolis police, and are appalled by the recent murders
  of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and countless others. More broadly,
  we call for an end to police terror and anti-Blackness. \n\nPeople have been left
  without the resources they need. Jobs and livelihoods will take a long time to recover.
  And most of all, Black citizens of St. Paul continue to live in a city that is currently
  upholding the St. Paul Police Department, which has brutalized and taken too many
  Black lives. Therefore, we will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions
  of reform. \n\nI call on the St. Paul City Council to take the following actions
  -\n1. Redirect funds divested from policing to provide educational opportunities
  for communities impacted by police violence.\n2. Commit resources to support community-led
  alternatives to policing.\n3. Propose plans for ensuring the safety of Black and
  other marginalized people in our community from racial profiling by police and other
  security forces with input from members of the marginalized communities themselves.
  \n4. Issue statements condemning these recent murders.\n\nAlthough the murder of
  George Floyd was the catalyst for these recent protests, it was not the sole cause.
  Black people have been subjected to centuries of state terror, and economic and
  social exclusion. The current protests reflect concerned members of society taking
  direct, collective action to demand an end to the abuse and violence directed against
  Black people. I am urging you, and the St. Paul City Council, to adopt a budget
  that defunds the police and funds non-violent, community-led, health and safety
  strategies.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
