body: "Dear Mayor and City Council,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME], I am a resident of
  [YOUR WARD/NEIGHBORHOOD]. We demand reallocation of funding from BPD to social and
  public programming that takes place in our communities. It is an outrage that nearly
  a quarter of the city funding for 2021 is planned towards the Police Department,
  including Police Chief Terryâ€™s exorbitant salary. \n\nWe demand that the City Council
  defund the BPD by joining similar calls across the country. We demand a budget that
  adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Bakersfield residents during
  this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget
  that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear
  them apart.\n\nIt is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to
  completely revise the Bakersfield city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to
  fund Care Not Cops. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
