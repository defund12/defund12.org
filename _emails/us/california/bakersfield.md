subject: Defund the Bakersfield Police Department
body: "Dear Mayor and City Council,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME], I am a resident of
  [YOUR WARD/NEIGHBORHOOD]. We demand reallocation of funding from BPD to social and
  public programming that takes place in our communities. It is an outrage that nearly
  a quarter of the city funding for 2021 is planned towards the Police Department,
  including Police Chief Terry’s exorbitant salary. \n\nWe demand that the City Council
  defund the BPD by joining similar calls across the country. We demand a budget that
  adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Bakersfield residents during
  this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget
  that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear
  them apart.\n\nIt is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to
  completely revise the Bakersfield city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to
  fund Care Not Cops. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
