subject: Los Altos Resident for Defunding the LAPD
body: "To Mayor Pepper and Los Altos City Council Members,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME],
  and I am a resident of Los Altos. This past week, our nation and community have
  been gripped by protests calling for an end to racism and anti-Blackness and a complete
  overhaul in our approach to criminal justice in America. We are demanding that our
  voices be heard, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its
  resources.\n\nThe fact that the Los Altos Police Department encompasses almost a
  third of the city’s operating budget while human resources like affordable housing
  and community programs receive only a small fraction of the budget is shameful and
  unproductive. Research shows that a living wage, access to holistic health services
  and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful
  at promoting community well-being and safety than police or prisons (Source: Popular
  Democracy).\n\nThere is not just a need for police reform, but police defunding
  and abolition, because the entire systemic structure of the policing is inherently
  corrupt and ineffective. The average police recruit spends 58 hours learning how
  to shoot and only 8 hours learning how to de-escalate (Source: Campaign Zero). They
  are not trained or equipped to react to the vast majority of crises. Phillip McHarris
  (doctoral candidate focusing on race), argues that we must work towards a reality
  in which healthcare workers and emergency response teams handle substance abuse,
  domestic violence, homelessness, and mental health cases. Policies to “improve the
  police” are not enough, as there’s no evidence that implicit bias training or community
  relations initiatives help with reducing the abuses of policing (The Nation). We
  need to reimagine public safety to prioritize community well-being and finding alternatives
  to conflict management, rather than defaulting to violent policing. \n\nWe demand
  the immediate freezing of budget increases to the police force, cancelling of cadet
  classes, demilitarization of the police force, and reallocation of funds from police
  to community-led health and safety strategies.\n\nPlease do not vote for more SRO’s
  in schools, militarized police, and officers patrolling our streets. Do not allow
  the city to increase police funding another 8%. Do not be complicit in the disproportionate
  targeting and continuous oppression of people of Black, Indigenous and People of
  Color. We demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers
  a police force that tears them apart.\n\nIt is your duty to represent your constituents.
  I am urging you to revise the Los Altos city budget for the next fiscal year and
  to fund CareNotCops. We can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have
  the courage to change.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
