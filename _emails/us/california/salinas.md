body: "Dear Mayor Gunter and Salinas City Councilmembers,\n\nI am writing to you as
  a resident of Salinas, asking that you budget for our community. As the nation mourns
  the loss of not only George Floyd, but the deaths of countless people of color at
  the hands of local law enforcement, now more than ever, we need to support our children
  and families.\n\nOur local police department is set to receive an increase of $447,026
  for 2020-2021 in their budget which is already nearly half of our entire general
  fund (45%). At the same time, our Library and Community Services Department is projected
  to lose $326,000 of their funding having only received 8% of our budget as it were.\n\nThis
  is unacceptable. The youngest members of our community deserve access to clean parks,
  online learning spaces and library resources, and to continue to have access to
  the quality sports, arts, and cultural programming taking place in our recreation
  centers. Furthermore, we need to fund mental health professionals, crisis de-escalators,
  and other resources for those suffering from domestic abuse and addiction, who are
  too often subjected to unjust policing.\n\nPlease take action to make the necessary
  investments for the future of our community. \n\nSincerely,\n[Resident Name, District
  (optional)]"
