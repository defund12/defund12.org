  To the City Administrator and the Ripon City Council,

  My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Ripon.

  This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police brutality, an end to racism and anti-Blackness, and immediate reform in how Black people are treated in America. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for 2019-2020 is poorly allocated. I am emailing you to demand an ethical and equal reallocation of the Ripon expense budget away from Ripon Police Department and towards the community center, parks, and the library.

  Redirect money away from the police department and into these programs that will benefit public health and the community. The budget for 2019-2020 suggests that the largest fraction of the city's budget should go to policing ($6,557,258) whereas the budget for the community center is a mere $98,971.

  If this is truly representative of the council's thoughts on how funds should be allocated, I am ashamed to call Ripon my home, and I am ashamed to call you my elected officials.

  Transitioning funding away from policing and into community programming such as educational opportunities, arts programs, community centers, healthcare, and mental health resources will strengthen our communities and make them safer for everyone. When every person has the resources they need to be healthy and safe, our community can thrive. This is a long transition process but change starts with reallocating this funding!

  We can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change.

  Sincerely,

  [YOUR NAME]
