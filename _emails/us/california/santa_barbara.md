  Dear Santa Barbara City Council,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD/DISTRICT]. I am writing to demand that the Santa Barbara City Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community well-being, and redirects funding away from the police.

  In 2019, the City of Santa Barbara allocated $42 million to our police system, an inordinate 32% of our total budget. This is compared to just $13 million allocated towards community development (9.2% of the budget). Within the community development budget, $1.05 million was projected to be spent on human services  (0.07% of the city's budget), with even less appropriated for housing development (0.04%).

  I demand that the City Council begin to meaningfully defund the Santa Barbara Police Department and to reallocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. We need a budget that reflects the actual needs of Santa Barbara residents.

  History has shown that police "reform" is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve&#151;and in fact actively harms&#151;our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.

  Thank you for your time,
