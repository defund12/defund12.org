body: "Dear Mayor Arreguín and Berkeley City Council Members,\n\nMy name is [NAME
  HERE] and I am a Berkeley resident from district [YOUR DISTRICT]. BPD takes an enormous
  share of the city’s general fund, and that percentage has risen exponentially for
  the last two decades, taking away desperately needed resources from essential city
  programs and services. 38% of our city’s budget goes towards the police department,
  while only 10% goes towards health, housing, and community service.\n\nBerkeley
  may be faced with up to a 28 million dollar budget deficit in the FY2020-2021 and
  is set to invest 43% of the general fund in policing. That 74 million dollars is
  being used at the expense of vital public services such as housing and healthcare.
  The investment in policing has not made us safer -- BPD remains an embarrassment
  to the city and a lethal threat to Berkeley’s Black and Brown communities, while
  increased police spending shows no correlation to decreasing crime levels over the
  past 20 years. With Berkeley’s current finances in dire jeopardy, it is clear that
  we must defund the police.\n\nAs a Berkeley resident, I demand that you take immediate
  action to ensure the following:\n\n1.Significantly reduce BPD’s allocation from
  the general fund \n2.Discontinue use of general fund dollars to pay for settlements
  due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence.\n3.Invest in housing, jobs, youth
  programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe.\n\nBerkeley
  can not wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The
  only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to defund BPD.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
