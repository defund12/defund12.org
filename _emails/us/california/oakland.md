subject: Defund OPD.  Invest in Community.
body: "Dear Mayor Schaaf and City Council Members,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I
  am an Oakland resident writing to urge you to defund OPD. \n\nOPD takes an enormous
  share of the city’s general fund, and that percentage has risen exponentially for
  the last two decades, taking away desperately needed resources from essential city
  programs and services. OPD has overspent its authorized overtime budget by 100%
  -- tens of millions of dollars -- in recent years, as individual cops bring home
  annual compensation upwards of $400k. The investment in policing has not made us
  safer -- OPD remains an embarrassment to the city and a lethal threat to Oakland’s
  Black and Brown communities, while increased police spending shows no correlation
  to decreasing crime levels over the past 20 years. With Oakland's current finances
  in dire jeopardy, it is clear that we must defund the police.\n\nAs Oakland residents,
  we therefore demand that you take immediate action to ensure the following:\n\n
  \ 1. Reduce OPD’s allocation from the General Fund by 50% (roughly $150 Million)\n
  \ 2. Disallow unauthorized overtime by OPD\n  3. Discontinue use of general fund
  dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence\n
  \ 4. Invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health
  workers to keep the community safe.\n\nOakland can not wait any longer for a budget
  that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate
  steps to Defund OPD. \n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]"
