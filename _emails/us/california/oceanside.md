  To Mayor Weiss and City Council Members,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of Oceanside, CA. I am writing to demand that you and the council members of Oceanside do what you can to take funds away from policing and invest directly in the underserved and over-policed communities of Oceanside.

  We are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence and racism of policing and a system of injustice in our prison system. I will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” I am demanding that my voice be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.

  Support for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. I join the calls of those across the country to defund the police. I demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Oceanside residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. I demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear it apart.

  As the City Council, the budget proposal is in your hands. It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund care, not cops. You need to adopt a People’s Budget. Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,

  Sincerely,
  [YOUR NAME]
