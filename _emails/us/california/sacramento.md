subject: Sacramento demands a People's Budget
body: |
  "To the council in charge of the allocation of funds to the Sacramento Police Department and the jails and prisons they fill,

  I am a resident of [YOUR DISTRICT]. I am writing to demand that the City Council adopt a People’s Budget that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police. This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-Blackness, and immediate reform in how Black people are treated in America. Sacramento and its government organizations are unfortunately guilty of complacency in the unfolding of systematic racism.

  First off, I fervently oppose the new Sacramento County jail. We should be reducing jail populations, not creating more cells that need to be filled. Jails are not an appropriate or effective way to deal with mental illness, drug use, or homelessness. Yet that is how the county and city use them. Please stop this reckless use of tax dollars and invest in real solutions. The councils should spend time considering other ways they can reduce jail populations and properly reintroduce folks to prevent recidivism.

  Call an emergency joint meeting of the City Council and County Board of Supervisors to address the response by law enforcement to the George Floyd protests. The police are responding to protesters with needless violence—their rubber bullets are causing destruction to bodies and businesses. Hold the Sacramento Police Department and the Sheriff’s Department accountable. Make them come up with a plan to end police-initiated violence specifically regarding the protests and into the future.

  Please call budget meetings to begin the process of reducing spending on police and sheriff by 30% and to develop funding reduction strategies for the following 4 years. The Sacramento Police Department propagates inequality in our city. Many Black and  Brown Sacramento residents have stories of police harassment, and the police are most violent when it comes to our most vulnerable populations: trans folks and the homeless. Systems of oppression must be undone, and reallocating much of the budget for the Sacramento Police Department to programs and city-led initiatives that support education, rehabilitation, public health, and community-oriented initiatives is a goal that must be achieved. None of the CARES federal stimulus funds should be spent on any law enforcement function. It should go towards providing housing and public health initiatives.

  Moving forward, please refuse political contributions from law enforcement unions. You are supposed to work for the people of Sacramento. We can not achieve the the drastic overhaul in policing while your hands are in their pockets.

  Lastly, please come together to elect a new District Attorney and Sheriff who are committed to racial justice, to ending mass incarceration and to stopping the killing of Black People. The current leaders have failed Black and Brown communities many times in the past and it's time for a change.

  We are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. I will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” I am demanding that our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.

  Support for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. I demand that the City Council defund the SPD. I join the calls of those across the country to defund the police. I demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Sacramento residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. I demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.

  As the City Council, the budget proposal is in your hands. It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund care not cops. You need to adopt a People’s Budget. Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,
