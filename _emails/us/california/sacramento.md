subject: Sacramento demands a People's Budget
body: "To the Sacramento City Council and the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors
  in charge of the allocation of funds to the Sacramento Police Department, the Sacramento
  Sheriff’s Department, and the County Jails they fill,\n\nI am writing to demand
  that the County Board of Supervisors and the City Council invest in community-led
  public health and safety that redirects funding away from law enforcement. Our nation
  has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard
  to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-Blackness, and immediate reform in
  how Black people are treated in America. Sacramento and its government organizations
  are guilty of complacency in perpetuating systematic racism.\n\nFirst, I fervently
  oppose the plans for a new Sacramento County jail tower and ask that you halt all
  investment in the design/build process. We should be reducing jail populations,
  not expanding the budget of Sacramento County’s jails. Please stop this reckless
  misuse of tax dollars and invest in real solutions to mental illness, substance
  use, and homelessness that prevent harm in our communities and actually keep us
  safe. Community-based organizations are ready to work with you to create alternative
  systems of accountability for our communities outside of the jail system. \n\nSacramento
  jail populations have already decreased over 30% since COVID-19 and we demand that
  the populations do not exceed 2,300, and that the jail populations be reduced to
  50% capacity by 2021. Start by removing requirements for those recently released
  to return to jail and prioritizing those who are elderly and immunocompromised for
  immediate releases. Additionally, we need universal COVID-19 testing in Sacramento
  County Jails for all who consent, and free distribution of masks, soap and cleaning
  supplies to protect those remaining in custody from COVID-19, without resorting
  to solitary confinement. \n\nAs the city police and sheriff’s deputies continue
  to be sued for their violent abuses of human rights, our community demands that
  absolutely no money from the General Fund be used to pay their legal settlements.
  Lawsuits against Sacramento sheriff, police, and jails need to be paid for by their
  respective departments and salaries, not taken from our General Fund. We need you
  to ensure that the General Fund prioritizes reversing systematic disinvestment in
  Black communities by funding schools, healthcare, parks, libraries, and community-based
  programs in Black neighborhoods in Sacramento.\n\nCall an emergency joint meeting
  of the City Council and County Board of Supervisors to address the response by law
  enforcement to the George Floyd protests. During this meeting, ensure that all public
  comments are heard by giving each individual at least 3 minutes to speak over a
  teleconferencing platform. The police are responding to protesters with are causing
  severe harm. Hold the Sacramento Police Department and the Sheriff’s Department
  accountable for the needless violence their rubber bullets and tear gas have inflicted,
  and end the use of these harmful weapons. Make them release all protestors still
  held in County Jails, drop all charges, stop making arrests, and create a plan to
  prevent any police presence at protests in the future. Transparency with the community
  is paramount and we demand updated data on daily citations, arrests, and incarcerations,
  with demographics. \n \nPlease call emergency budget meetings to begin the process
  of reducing spending on police and sheriff by at least 30% in the 2020/21 budget
  and to develop funding reduction strategies for the following 4 years with deep
  community involvement. The City Council must also immediately restore the looted
  $10 million from the Measure U funding. The CARES Act stimulus fund allocations
  at the city and county level need to be led by community-based, grassroots, organizations,
  and should not be spent on any law enforcement function.\n\nThe Sacramento Police
  Department propagates inequality in our city. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Black
  and Brown Sacramento residents have stories of police harassment, and the police
  are most violent when it comes to our most vulnerable populations: trans folks and
  unhoused people. Systems of oppression must be undone, and reallocating much of
  the budget for the Sacramento Police Department and Sacramento Sheriff’s Department
  to programs and community-led initiatives that support education, rehabilitation,
  public health, and community-oriented initiatives is a goal that must be achieved.
  \n\nMoving forward, please refuse political contributions from law enforcement unions.
  You are supposed to work for the people of Sacramento. We can not achieve the drastic
  overhaul in policing while your hands are in their pockets.\n\nLastly, please come
  together to elect a new District Attorney and Sheriff who are committed to ending
  mass incarceration and to stopping the killing of Black People. Immediately rescind
  your endorsements for Anne Marie Schubert and Scott Jones, and work to elect new
  leaders committed to racial justice.\n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval
  over the systemic violence of policing. We will no longer accept empty gestures
  and suggestions of “reform.” We are demanding that our voices be heard now, and
  that real change be made to the way this city and county allocates our resources.
  We need to reinvest in community-based programs that actually keep our communities
  safe.\n\nSupport for communities is needed now, more than ever. We demand that you
  listen to members of our community and fully pass the Black New Deal.  We demand
  that the City Council defund the Sacramento Police Department. We demand that the
  Board of Supervisors defund the Sacramento Sheriff’s Department. We join the calls
  of those across the country to defund the police. We demand a budget that adequately
  and effectively meets the needs of all Sacramento residents during this trying and
  uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget that supports
  community wellbeing, rather than one that empowers police forces that tear them
  apart.\n\nAs the City Council and County Board of Supervisors, the budget proposal
  is in your hands. It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you
  to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund care,
  not cops and cages. \n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME] \n[YOUR ADDRESS] \n[YOUR
  EMAIL] \n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
