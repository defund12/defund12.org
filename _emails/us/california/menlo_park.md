body: "Dear Menlo Park City Council,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident
  of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD/DISTRICT]. I am writing to demand that the Menlo Park City
  Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community well-being, and redirects
  funding away from the police.\n\nIn 2018, the City of Menlo Park allocated $25.37
  million dollars to Government and Public Safety, with $17.8 million specifically
  for police funding. This means police funding is an inordinate 70% of the Government
  and Public Safety budget, and 21% of our total budget. This is compared to just
  $6.3 million allocated towards community development (7.5% of the budget). Within
  the community development budget in 2018, $4.5 million (72% of the Community Development
  budget) was spent on Construction Regulation and no money was allocated to housing,
  redevelopment or employment.\n\nI demand that the City Council begin meaningfully
  defunding the Menlo Park Police Department and reallocate those funds to programs
  proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based
  mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs,
  and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Menlo Park residents.\n\nHistory
  has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways
  that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community,
  and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.\n\nThank you for
  your time, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
