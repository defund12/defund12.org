subject: Commit to reallocate for social equity
body: "Dear Glendale Mayor and City Council, \n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a
  resident of [YOUR DISTRICT/NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am writing to demand that the City Council
  adopt a budget that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from
  the police. \n\nNot only are we experiencing the trauma of global pandemic, we are
  also in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence embodied by
  American police departments’ well-documented history of murdering Black people.
  Empty gestures and suggestions of “reform” are unacceptable. I am demanding that
  the City Council of Glendale stand with the People. I am demanding that you root
  out systemic and institutional racism by defunding the police and prioritizing and
  reallocating much-needed funds to education, housing, and community and social services.\n\nI
  also entreat you to stand in solidarity with the movement by demanding change from
  the LAPD. As neighbors, we are duty-bound to hold each other accountable. I join
  the calls of those across the country to meaningfully defund the police.  The people
  are demanding a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowering
  the police forces that tear them apart. \n\nYou need to adopt a budget that prioritizes
  the social programs proven to promote safety and equity much more effectively than
  policing. You need to steadfastly pressure your peers on the City Council of Los
  Angeles to dothe same. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOURNAME]\n[YOUR
  ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
