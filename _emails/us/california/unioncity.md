body: "To Mayor Dutra, the Union City Council, Union City Manager, and Union City
  Police Chief,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Union City. I am
  writing to demand that the City Council adopts a budget that prioritizes community
  wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police.  \n\nThis past week, we have
  seen widespread protests across the country and even right here in the Tri-City
  area. These protests are not simply a response to the recent murder of George Floyd
  at the hands of the Minneapolis police; they are the continuation of a larger movement
  calling for the end of decades of endemic police brutality, and the end of a racist
  hierarchy that this country was founded on. I am writing to you today because it
  has come to my attention that the Union City proposed budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal
  year helps to uphold this same system.  \n\nUnion City council states that it prides
  itself on the City’s diversity and core values of “safety, tolerance, and caring.”
  However, the proposed $26,015,635 to be allocated to UCPD from the City’s 2020-2021
  General Funds states otherwise. This proposal is more than 2x the proposed 2020-2021
  allocation for Union City Public Works, Community & Recreation Services, and Economic
  & Community Development combined. If we are a city that truly stands by our core
  values of protecting and caring for our diverse community, you as a council would
  redirect funding away from the police and into social programs and services that
  support education, health care, community-led public safety, and other critical
  community needs.  \nDuring the Union City Town Hall on June 4, 2020, Reverend Jerome
  Brown brought up valuable points about hearing one another in order to spark change.
  I ask that as our representatives, you hear us and spark this very important and
  needed change in our City. I am urging you to revise the budget for the 2020-2021
  fiscal year to defund the police.  \n\nSincerely,  \n[YOUR NAME]\t\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\t\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\t\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
