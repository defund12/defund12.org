body: "To Mayor Dutra, the Union City Council, Union City Manager, and Union City
  Police Chief:  \nMy name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Union City. I am
  writing to demand that the City Council adopts a budget that prioritizes community
  wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police.  \nThis past week, we have
  seen widespread protests across the country and even right here in the Tri-City
  area. These protests are not simply a response to the recent murder of George Floyd
  at the hands of the Minneapolis police; they are an amplification of a small piece
  in a much larger movement, one which has culminated for years and which calls for
  the end of police brutality and the end of the racist and oppressive system that
  this country was founded on. I am writing to you today because it has come to my
  attention that the Union City proposed budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year helps
  to uphold this same system.  \nUnion City council states that it prides itself on
  the City’s diversity and core values of “safety, tolerance, and caring.” However,
  the proposed $26,015,635 to be allocated to UCPD from the City’s 2020-2021 General
  Funds states otherwise. This proposal is more than 2x the proposed 2020-2021 allocation
  for Union City Public Works, Community & Recreation Services, and Economic & Community
  Development combined. If we are a city that truly stands by our core values of protecting
  and caring for our diverse community, you as a council would redirect funding away
  from the police and into social programs and services that support education, health
  care, community-led public safety, and other critical community needs.  \nDuring
  the Union City Town Hall on June 4, 2020, Reverend Jerome Brown brought up valuable
  points about hearing one another in order to spark change. I ask that as our representatives,
  you hear us and spark this very important and needed change in our City. I am urging
  you to revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year to defund the police.  \nSincerely,
  \ \n[YOUR NAME]\t\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\t\n[YOUR EMAIL]\t\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
