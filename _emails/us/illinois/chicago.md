subject: Commit to reallocate for social equity / Defund the CPD
body: "Hello, \n\nMy name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY]. I
  am extremely concerned with the City of Chicago’s inordinate investment in the Chicago
  Police Department (CPD) at the expense of critical youth, education, and health
  services. As demonstrated by ongoing peaceful protests and a 2019 Gallup poll, a
  majority of individuals living in Chicago view the police negatively. \n\nI am therefore
  writing to demand that the City Council vote to reapportion funds allocated to the
  CPD to support evidence-based programs and services that, unlike increased police
  presence, promote the well-being of citizens and reduce crime. It is morally reprehensible
  to dedicate 40% of the City’s operating budget (approximately $4 million per day)
  towards policing while thousands of citizens are homeless and many more lack access
  to essential services, including clean running water and necessary mental health
  resources. \n\nI also urge the City Council to enact legislation that holds police
  accountable and to overturn policies that allow police to engage in unlawful behavior
  with impunity. \n\nPeople are marching in the streets because they know that these
  actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to please listen
  to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action to address their concerns.
  \n\nThank you, \n\n[YOUR NAME]\n\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n\n[YOUR PHONE
  NUMBER]\n"
