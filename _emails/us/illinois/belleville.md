  Dear Mayor Eckert, Councilmembers, and Elected Officials,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY]. Given the history of policing and the most recent murders of Black people, I am asking you to redirect money away from the Belleville PD in the 2021 budget. The police department currently receives more than 35% of the city’s general budget [1], and I believe that funding should be allocated differently.

  Belleville should have a budget that reflects our community’s priorities and needs. I demand you to advocate for a meaningful reallocation of the city’s expenditures: away from the Belleville Police Department, and towards social programs and resources that support housing, jobs, education, health care, child care, and other critical community needs. Beyond policing our community, these services are proven to be more effective in improving community safety and wellness.

  I demand a budget that supports community well-being. Please consider your role in enriching and empowering our communities, especially during a time of racial injustice, widespread illness, and economic vulnerability.

  Thank you,
  [YOUR NAME]
  [YOUR ADDRESS]
  [YOUR EMAIL]
  [YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
