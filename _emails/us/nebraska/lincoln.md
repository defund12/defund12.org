body: "Dear Mayor Gaylor Bairdand Members of City Council,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME]
  and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY]. I write this letter to urge you to begin
  defunding and demilitarizing the Lincoln Police Department. LPD’s budget has increased
  by 14% since the 2017-2018 budget. For the 2019-2020 year, the portion of the general
  fund spent on LPD was just under 25%. LPD’s increased funding is a direct harm to
  other necessary and more needed services in our city. Other services including parks
  and recreation, transportation and utilities, and urban development take much less
  out of the general costing the city 9.8%, 1.3%, and 0.5% respectively (Source: 2018-2020
  Council Adopted Biennial Operating Budget). LPD is a direct cost to other services
  this city desperately needs.\n\nAs Lincoln residents, we therefore demand that you
  take immediate action to ensure the following:\n\n* Reduce LPD's allocation from
  the General Fund.\n* Reallocate those funds into housing, jobs, youth programs,
  restorative justice, mental health workers, and community development programs to
  keep the community safe.\n* Disallow unauthorized overtime by LPD.\n* Discontinue
  use of General Fund dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct,
  and negligence. \n\nLincoln cannot wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs
  of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to defund
  LPD.\n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
