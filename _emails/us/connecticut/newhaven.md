  Dear Mayor Elicker and New Haven Board of Alders members,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am emailing to demand a more ethical plan for the next New Haven expense budget that shifts funds away from the NHPD and towards resources that address community well-being at the core, like public health services, youth programs, social services, public works projects, and education. Despite yearly crime rates dropping in our state overall, the crime rates in CT's major cities remain high due a deeply embedded socioeconomic divide that has historically negatively impacted Black and Brown residents. A disproportionate amount of the city budget is going toward policing when it should be going toward enriching our communities in need with the ultimate goal of ending the need for excessive patrolling on the street.

  While the document for the budget approved on May 26, 2020 is not yet available online, it is my understanding that the Mayor's Proposed Budget for FY2020-21 is a close indicator. According to data available in the Proposed Budget, $43 million was allocated to Police Service. That figure is more than the combined total proposed for Public Health ($11.5 million), Youth & Recreation ($4.8 million), Community Services Administration ($4.5 million), and the Department of Public Works and Parks ($15.9 million). Furthermore, New Haven Public Schools requested a $10.8 million budget increase, were met with a much lower proposal from the Mayor's office of $3.5 million, and in the end, only received a $1 million increase in the final budget.

  It is your duty to represent the voices of your constituents. The numbers that have shown up to demonstrations in New Haven against police brutality are proof that the people want to see a drastic shift in how community safety is addressed. I join the call of those across the country, across the globe, for a reimagining of public safety that focuses on the health and well-being of our community instead of relying on armed police officers. I am urging you to look at the next city budget as an opportunity to create long term, effective change in New Haven.

  Thank you,

  [YOUR NAME]
