  Dear Mayor Bollwage and City Council,

  My name is [YOUR NAME], resident of Union County. In light of the Black Lives Matter movement, I am writing to request that your budget for next year prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from law enforcement and corrections facilities that continue to disproportionately target Black, Brown, and Indigenous Americans and other minorities.

  The 2020 budget allocated more than $33 million towards the police and sheriff departments and a further $39.2 million for juvenile and adult corrections facilities. Rather than spending over $70 million annually for punishing criminals, please consider cutting some of this budget to address some of the issues that cause criminality.

  For instance, this yearâ€™s budget left room for only $887,323 to youth services, $1.3 million to family support services, $313,373 for employment and training, and only $190,000 for a scholarship program. This is only $2.7 million in total, less than 4% of the budget spent on policing and corrections. Furthermore, the $1.7 million that was available for social services to the homeless in 2019 seems to be completely taken out of the budget for 2020, a year where it was likely very much needed due to unprecedented unemployment rates.

  I, as your constituent, urge you to take a closer look at what Union County can do to mitigate the harm that has been caused by the over-policing of minorities throughout the years, and become a leader in creating a community where residents have resources available to them to break the systemic cycle of poverty and oppression that has been the norm for so many years.

  Thank you for your time,
  [YOUR NAME]
