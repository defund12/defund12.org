subject: We Demand Divestment from Police and an Investment in Our Communities
body: "Hello,\n\nMy name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am asking
  to redirect money away from the Memphis PD and into the following social services:
  \n* Community Development;\n* COVID Relief;\n* Education, Parks & Recreation. \n\nI
  request that an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect
  in order to deny the mayor’s proposed budget and reallocate these funds to resources
  the citizens can benefit from.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR
  ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
