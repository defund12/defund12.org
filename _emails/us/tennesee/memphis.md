body: "Dear Memphis City Councilors,\n\nMy name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD].
  I am asking to redirect money away from the Memphis PD and into the following social
  services and community needs: \n* Community Development and Job Creation;\n* COVID
  Relief during this crisis and long-term healthcare;\n* Education;\n* Housing;\n*
  Child Care;\n* Parks & Recreation. \n\nI request that an emergency meeting be called
  before the fiscal year goes into effect in order to deny the mayorâ€™s proposed budget
  and reallocate these funds to resources that promote equity and community well-being
  for Memphis residents. \n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
