subject: Demand for Redistribution of Funds Allocated To LVMPD
body: |-
  I am a resident of Las Vegas. I am writing to demand that Mayor Carolyn Goodman and City Council to do everything in their power to adopt a budget that prioritizes our community well being and redirects funding away from the police in the next budget evaluation period.

  We have seen mounting evidence that police departments are racist and ineffective institutions that put citizens at risk of injury and death, yet the police budget accounts for 13% of our general fund.

  I ask that you redirect the majority of the $174M allotted for crime prevention towards community programs that provide citizens with basic human needs like affordable healthcare, housing, and education. With nearly 35% of our residents currently unemployed, we need funding to address the needs of people hurting from the effects of COVID 19, people experiencing homelessness, and the marginalized communities in our city.

  Social programs and education have been shown to be far more effective than policing at promoting community safety and equity.

  Our community is in pain along with the nation. We desperately need a reevaluation of the role of police in our city.

  Thank you for your time,
