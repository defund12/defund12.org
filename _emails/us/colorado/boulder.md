  Dear Council Members of the City of Boulder,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am writing to you regarding the harassment of Zayd Atkinson, a resident of Boulder and a student at Naropa University, by the Boulder Police Department. Instead of funding the harassment of Boulder residents of color, the city should fund affordable housing.

  Based on the 2020 budget that you approved in October 2019, the Boulder Police Department received $38,629,082, which represents an ~8% increase since 2018. Meanwhile, the budget for Housing and Human Services for 2020 is $21,655,671, representing a staggering 28% reduction in budget since 2018. Most of those cuts come from a reduction in funding to "Community Investment" for Housing. That's untenable, especially coming from a city that prides itself in promoting equity. I strongly suggest that the Boulder Police Department be defunded immediately and that the money go towards creating and maintaining affordable housing within city limits. I would also like to see policy enacted around increasing limits on unrelated residents within a home.

  Thank you for your time,
