body: "Dear Council Members of the City of Boulder,\n\nMy name is [NAME] and I am
  a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am writing to urge you to defund the Boulder Police
  Department.\n\nBased on the 2020 budget that you approved in October 2019, the Boulder
  Police Department received $38,629,082, which represents an ~8% increase since 2018.
  Meanwhile, the budget for Housing and Human Services for 2020 is $21,655,671, representing
  a staggering 28% reduction in budget since 2018. Most of those cuts come from a
  reduction in funding to \"Community Investment\" for Housing. That's untenable,
  especially coming from a city that prides itself in promoting equity and being on
  the progressive edge of history. \n\nIn light of these statistics, and in the wake
  of the Minneapolis City Council pledging to completely reimagine policing in their
  city, I strongly support the Boulder Police Department being defunded immediately,
  and that the money go towards creating affordable housing within city limits. I
  also want you to consider pledging that money to other community programs that invest
  in restorative justice, mental health, and our youth. Finally, I would like to see
  policy enacted around increasing limits on unrelated residents within a home.\n\nI
  also want to surface the harassment of Zayd Atkinson, a resident of Boulder and
  a student at Naropa University, by the Boulder Police Department. Instead of funding
  the harassment of Boulder residents of color, the city should fund affordable housing
  and other community programs.\n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
