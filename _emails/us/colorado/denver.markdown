subject: Defund Denver PD
body: |-
  Dear Denver City Council,

  I write to demand a reallocation of funding from Denver PD to social and public programming that takes place in our communities.

  I join the calls of those across the country to Defund the Police. With record unemployment and a seemingly intractable pattern of abuse an unequal treatment by police, we need  a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Denver residents. For FY2020, while over $500,000,000 was allocated for policing (40% of the budget) only $7.7m was allocated for safety net programs. In a June 6 interview, Mayor Hancock said that there is no plan to address this inequality. This is unacceptable, and I demand that the city council remedy this gross display of priorities. You must support a budget that supports social equity in our community, rather than empowering the police forces that tear us apart.

  It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to advocate for revision of the Denver city budget for the upcoming fiscal year, to reflect the decades of research showing that education and social programs much better promote the safety of a city than policing.

  Thank you for your time,
