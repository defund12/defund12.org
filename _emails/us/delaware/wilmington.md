  Dear Council Members of the City of Wilmington,

  My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of [YOUR DISTRICT]. I am writing to demand that the City Council adopts a People’s Budget that prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from the police.

  Our country is in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. As your constituent, I will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.”

  Support for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. The City Council must defund the police department. This city needs a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Wilmington residents during this trying and uncertain time; a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.

  As members of the City Council, the budget proposal is in your hands. It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund care, not cops. You must adopt a People’s Budget. Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,

  [YOUR NAME]
