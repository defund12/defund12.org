subject: Defund Wilmington Police Department
body: |-
  Dear Council Members of the City of Wilmington,

  My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of [YOUR DISTRICT]. I am writing to demand that the City Council adopts a budget for the people--one that prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from the police.

  Our country is in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. As a resident of Wilmington, I will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.”

  Support for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. The City Council must defund the police department. This city needs a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of impacted Wilmington residents during this trying and uncertain time--a budget that supports community well-being, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.

  As members of the City Council, the budget proposal is in your hands. It is your duty to represent the residents of Wilmington. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund care, not cops. You must adopt a budget for the people. Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,
