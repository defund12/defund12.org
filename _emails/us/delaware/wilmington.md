subject: Defund Wilmington Police Department
body: |-
  Dear Wilmington City and County officials,

  My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of [YOUR DISTRICT]. I am writing to demand that the governments of Wilmington adopt budgets for the people--that prioritize community well-being and redirect funding away from the police.

  Our country is in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. As a resident of Wilmington, I will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.”

  Support for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. The City Council must defund the police department, which consumes more of the city's finances than health, housing, and parks combined. The county must do the same, with new castle police representing by far the largest county expenditure. This city needs a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of impacted Wilmington residents during this trying and uncertain time--a budget that supports community well-being, rather than empowering the police forces that tear them apart. Our militarized police should not be responsible for responding to the vast majority of community problems. Further, social programs and education have long been shown to be much more effective than policing at promoting safe and equitable communities.

  As our local representatives, the budgets that most directly impact our lives are in your hands. It is your duty to represent the residents of Wilmington. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund care, not cops. You must adopt a budget for the people. Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,
