  "Civil Servants,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/BOROUGH/CITY].\n\nI
  am writing to ask that you provide no new funding for the Portland Police Department
  (PPD) and that you halt all funding that has already been approved in order to begin
  defunding the police immediately.\n\nAccording to the City Manager's Recommended
  Budget, PPD received an overall increase of 5.3% in the budget plan for 2020. I
  ask you to refuse to increase the budget for PPD and rather reallocate funding for
  PPD to organizations for essential human services including education, social services,
  housing, job creation. \n\nWith the economic impact that COVID-19 has had on Portland’s
  economy, difficult and thoughtful decisions will be required regarding the budget
  for Portland for 2021. Residents of Portland are experiencing homelessness, illness,
  unemployment, loss of income, and police brutality in record numbers. The people
  that have bear the brunt of this are People of Color, Indigenous peoples, the poor,
  and the working class.\n\nData shows that Black people are disproportionately more
  likely to be policed, arrested, and incarcerated than white people in Portland.
  This proves that systemic racism is present here in Portland and is perpetuated
  by the Portland Police Department. Defunding the police will be the first step towards
  improving the quality of living for Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) that
  are residents of Portland. It will divert funds from going to an institutionally
  racist association and allow those funds to be diverted to human services that need
  them badly.\n\nPlease do the right thing. Prioritize the health, safety and well-being
  of Portland residents.\n\nREFUSE TO FUND THE PORTLAND POLICE DEPARTMENT.\n\nThank
  you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
