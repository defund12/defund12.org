  Dear Mayor Joseph M. Petty and Members of the Worcester City Council,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of Worcester, MA. In light of the events that have occurred including but not limited to the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor I demand to see the reduction of funding for the Worcester Police Department. Rather than invest in a system that has been founded on racist principles and that has perpetuated the unnecessary deaths of so many Black people nation wide, I suggest we reallocate money towards building up and supporting the Black and Brown communities that make Worcester the city it is.

  The 2020 fiscal budget allocated over $52 million to the Worcester Police Department, more than the budget for Health and Human Services, Human Resources, and Public Works and Parks combined. I believe that this money could be have a greater use being invested in education, healthcare, and countless other social programs at the benefit of Worcester's Black and Brown communities. The City Council must take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing.

  Racist police violence doesn’t just happen in other cities - it happens here in Worcester too. However, with action we can create change. The City Council must stop investing so large sums of money into a system created to perpetuate racism and discrimination and fund what Black and Brown communities need to be safe and healthy: COVID19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, healing, cooperative businesses, community centers, community-led organizations and projects.

  Sincerely,
  [YOUR NAME]
