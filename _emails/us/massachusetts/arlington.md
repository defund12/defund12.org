  Dear Town Meeting Manager Chapdelaine, Select Board Members Mahon, Curro, Dunn, Hurd, DeCourcey, and Town Moderator Leone,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/BOROUGH/CITY]. I am writing to demand that the Arlington Police Department be defunded. Our nation has been gripped by protests in every single state, calling for an end to police brutality. Police "reform" has been proven ineffective over and over again. NYPD banned chokeholds in 1993; the NYPD murdered Anthony Baez in 1994 and Eric Garner in 2014 by chokehold. Oklahoma currently requires "de-escalation training," yet has the third highest police-involved killings rate in the country. In 2014, Tamir Rice was killed by Cleveland PD, a department that had "warn before shooting" and de-escalation requirements already in place. We know that "reform" does not work.

  It's easy to think that Arlington and APD don't have anything to do with high-profile police killings and protests. However, supporting national protests while thinking that Arlington is somehow different prevents us from realizing changes need to be made in our community. APD is complicit in supporting the expression of police violence: APD Lieutenant Rick Pedrini's letter in the 2018 edition of The Sentinel exposed the violent, racist ideas that innumerable cops across the country share. The murderous sentiments expressed by Pedrini are echoed in the actions of the cop who kneeled on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes. Pedrini is still an employee of the APD, paid by the tax dollars of the people he wanted to "put down." No amount of restorative justice training can change the fact that police exist to uphold unfair systems at the expense of the community they are supposed to be protecting.

  Defunding the police is not a radical idea. The Minneapolis City Council has already detailed a plan for completely abolishing city police and allocating the police budget towards community services that actually help reduce crime. In 2019, Arlington spent $8,214,876 on police compared to $425,891 on Health and Human Services. What would Arlington look like if that $8 million was invested in the community?

  Police “reform” is not enough. We should take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our town. We need to listen to those who have been directly and indirectly affected by racism in the APD and Arlington as a whole. We MUST defund the APD, and we must do it now.

  Thank you for your time,
