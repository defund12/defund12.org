subject: Reject the mayor's FY 2021 budget
body: "Dear Councilor, \n\nMy name is [NAME] and I live in the city of Northampton,
  MA. I’m writing to ask that City Council reject Mayor David Narkewicz’s proposal
  to expand police funding of nearly $200,000. In the budget, this proposed expansion
  is justified as necessary to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis and enforce “compliance
  with social distancing” (Narkewicz 2020). This despite the fact that experts across
  the country have urged against utilizing policing as a mechanism to respond to social
  and health problems (Gangi 2020). \n\nIncreased policing only compounds public health
  crises and the terror of this pandemic, particularly for Black, Indigenous, and
  Brown People of Color who are disproportionately affected both by the current economic
  and health emergency and by police brutality. \n\nAs a resident of Northampton,
  I demand that this money is funneled into uplifting our communities, not police.
  Our community needs housing, health care, and food. I demand that the budget be
  rejected and a new one be created where this money is redirected away from the Northampton
  PD into the following social service programs: Health Services, Housing Services,
  Senior Services, Community Legal Aid, and Human Services. \n\nDecrease the police
  budget and invest in our communities.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
