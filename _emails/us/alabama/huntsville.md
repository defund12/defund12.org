body: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am writing to
  demand that the Huntsville City Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community
  wellbeing, and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nThe proposed budget for
  2020 allocates 31.7% (50,541,228) of the personnel budget towards police.  This
  is more than the next highest two budget categories combined (Fire & Rescue and
  Public Works).  \n\nI demand that the City Council meaningfully redirect money away
  from the Huntsville PD and proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable
  community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services,
  affordable housing programs, and more.  I demand a budget that will benefit the
  community and make the city of Huntsville a better, more equitable place to live.\n\nWe
  donâ€™t need a militarized police force. We need to create a space in which more mental
  health service providers, social workers, victim/survivor advocates, religious leaders,
  neighbors, and friends - all of the people who really make up our community - can
  look out for one another.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
