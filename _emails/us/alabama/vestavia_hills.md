  Dear Mayor Curry and City Council,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/BOROUGH/CITY]. I am emailing you today to demand that the Vestavia Hills Police Department (VHPD) be defunded and that the budget and resources of the VHPD be allocated to social service programs that are more effective at promoting community safety. Police presence has been proven time and time again to be ineffective at protecting the citizens of Vestavia Hills. Often, police presence results in the death of an innocent person of color (POC). I am outraged by the incompetence of Vestavia Hills city officials and their lack of insight to see the VHPDâ€™s use of excessive force against the people of Vestavia Hills, especially POC. Police have terrorized my community for too long, and I am asking that you put a stop to it. Defund the Vestavia Hills Police Department and allocate those funds to social service programs that better protect our community and are more effective at promoting community safety.

  Ask yourself what side of history you want to be on. I hope that you choose the side of the people.

  Black Lives Matter,

  [YOUR NAME]
