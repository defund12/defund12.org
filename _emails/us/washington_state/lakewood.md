  Dear Mayor Anderson, Deputy Mayor Whalen, City Manager Caulfield, and Lakewood City Council members,
  
  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [CITY, STATE]. This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful reevaluation of the role of policing in our communities and an end to racism. I am writing to call upon this city council to restructure the 2021 city budget to adhere to your mission statement of: “Quality lifestyle fostered by a transparent government”.
  
  I am asking this City Council to show your commitment to this community by making meaningful changes to the cities priorities as reflected in the budget. In 2019 the City of Lakewood allocated 27% of it’s 205 million dollars in expenses to the police department [1]. I demand that the City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Lakewood Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community. We need funding for community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, and affordable housing programs. Police officers should not need to be the first resource for every crisis. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Lakewood residents.
  
  I am also writing to demand justice for Said Joquin, a Black man who was murdered by a Lakewood police officer on May 1, and so many murdered Black Americans before him. Said Joquin was pulled over for running a stop sign and was cooperating with police when he was shot. The city put the officer involved on administrative leave. I believe that Officer Mike Wiley is guilty of murder and should not be allowed to serve after being linked to the murder of another unarmed Black man in 2013 [2]. This is unacceptable. Administrative leave is not enough. I demand that this officer be fired and arrested for his crimes.
  
  History has shown that police “reform” is not enough. More money spent on policy changes and training programs will not fix our current system. I ask that this committee take a hard look at the way the current system fails to serve this community and come together to reimagine the role of police in the city of Lakewood.
  
  Thank you for your time,
