subject: We Demand Justice for Manuel Ellis and Reallocation of TPD Funds
body: "Dear Mayor Woodards and Tacoma City Council,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and
  I am a resident of [CITY,STATE]. I am writing to demand justice for Manuel Ellis,
  an innocent Black man who was murdered by Tacoma police officers on March 3, and
  so many murdered Black people before him.\n\nDespite autopsy evidence ruling Ellis’
  death a homicide, the officers involved in this murder have not been charged and
  are still employed at the Tacoma Police Department. This is unacceptable. Administrative
  leave is not enough. I demand that these officers be fired and arrested for their
  crimes.\n\nI am also asking the City of Tacoma to show your commitment to racial
  justice moving forward by opposing any increase in the Tacoma Police Department’s
  budget, and re-allocating city resources from policing to services that keep Black
  people safe, such as healthcare, education, and community programs. \n\nThank you,\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
