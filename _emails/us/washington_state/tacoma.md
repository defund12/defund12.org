subject: We Demand Justice for Manuel Ellis and Reallocation of TPD Funds
body: |-
  Dear Mayor Woodards and Tacoma City Council,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [CITY,STATE]. I am writing to demand justice for Manuel Ellis, an innocent Black man who was murdered by Tacoma police officers on March 3, and so many murdered Black people before him.

  Despite autopsy evidence ruling Ellis’ death a homicide, the officers involved in this murder have not been charged and are still employed at the Tacoma Police Department. This is unacceptable. Administrative leave is not enough. I demand that these officers be fired and arrested for their crimes.

  I am also asking the City of Tacoma to show your commitment to racial justice moving forward by opposing any increase in the Tacoma Police Department’s budget, and re-allocating city resources from policing to services that keep Black people safe, such as healthcare, education, and community programs.

  Thank you,

  [YOUR NAME]
