body: "Dear City Council Members & Mayor Margo,\n\nMy name is \\[NAME\\]. I am a resident
  of \\[NEIGHBORHOOD\\] in El Paso, Texas. I write this letter today to demand a complete
  overhaul on our El Paso Police Department. In light of, and in solidarity with,
  the protests across the US and in our city against the lives lost at the hands of
  the police, the El Paso community is calling for the immediate defunding of the
  EPPD and reinvestment in our communities.\n\nI join our community in demanding that
  you, my local officials, will: \n\nVote NO on all increases to police budgets\nVote
  YES to decrease police spending and budgets\nVote YES to increase spending on health
  care, education, and community development initiatives and programs that keep up
  safe.\n\nThe El Paso Police Department is funded at a drastically higher amount
  than all other city programs. In 2019, EPPD received: 5 times as much than parks
  & recreation, 9 times as much as public health, 12 times as much as human and community
  development, 15 times as much as libraries, 29 times as much as museum and cultural
  affairs, and 363 times as much as support for the unhoused \\[1\\].\n\nI demand
  that this council reallocate funds towards building healthy communities, especially
  those that are most vulnerable as Covid-19 has exposed. It should go towards the
  health of our elders and children, to social services, to neighborhood infrastructure,
  to education, to childcare, to homelessness, to dismantling racial inequality, to
  supporting a vibrant future for our city.\n\nThe possibilities are endless if you
  commit to investing in our communities, not in policing them. El Paso cannot wait
  any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve
  this is to take immediate steps to defund EPPD.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe People of El
  Paso, TX\n\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE
  NUMBER\\]\n\n\\[1\\] elpasotexas.gov/omb"
