body: "Dear Mayor Hollingsworth and members of the Hyattsville City Council,\n\nMy
  name is [X] and I'm a Hyattsville resident living in Ward [X]. I am writing to demand
  that in the upcoming fiscal year the city of Hyattsville eliminate funding for the
  city's police department. We live in a truly multicultural city, however, arrests
  and police harassment are largely borne by our communities of color. Given that
  Prince George's County is one of the wealthiest minority-majority counties in the
  country, this is unacceptable and anathema to the progressive views that our residents
  hold true.\n\nOver the course of the past three fiscal years there has been a 23%
  increase on spending for the police department--an increase that is at odds with
  increases in other areas of governance that are more impactful on residents' quality
  of life and trust in the city's leadership. In FY20 spending on the police department
  comprised 26% of the entire budget for the city. This amount represents more than
  $450 in spending per resident for police services that largely do not improve their
  quality of life, and generally detract from it. In the same budget that allocates
  more than 1/4 of our city's funding to police, the city of Hyattsville is spending
  25 times LESS on community development programs like youth initiatives, the arts
  and public health/recreation.\n\nThis is an imbalance that can only be righted by
  stripping funding from the police department. Rather than spending several million
  dollars to purchase and retrofit a building for a new police headquarters, the city
  should be spending that money in order to increase services for public safety such
  as educational initiatives, mental health programs, ensuring access to affordable
  housing in all 5 wards of Hyattsville, and doing more to support and promote employment
  and vocational training programs.\n\nThe state of Maryland has the highest number
  of black men incarcerated per capita, and the city of Hyattsville police department
  plays a role in this sobering statistic. We have seen numerous videos of police
  brutality within our county, including a 2019 officer-involved shooting by a Prince
  George's County officer here in Hyattsville that resulted in the death of a Black
  man. Why should the police be funded given their history of violence within our
  community? In our schools, school resource officers contribute to the school to
  prison pipeline and continue to make our children feel unsafe. Hyattsville police
  officers should be removed, immediately, from all public schools in the city beginning
  this Fall when the 2020-2021 academic year commences.\n\nYour job as elected officials
  is to take action to make the city of Hyattsville a better place to live for ALL
  residents. Today I am asking you to stand with me and defund the city of Hyattsville
  police department and allocate those dollars to social programs that will make Hyattsville,
  per one of our city's mottos, A Good Place to Live.\n\nSincerely, \n[YOUR NAME]
