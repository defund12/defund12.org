subject: Commit to reallocate for social equity
body: "\"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a Baltimore
  resident. In the midst of this pandemic and public outcry against police brutality,
  it feels especially inappropriate to propose an increase to the BPD budget to $545
  million. I urge you to ethically reallocate this increase, as well as a meaningful
  portion of the remaining BPD budget, towards social services and education. Investment
  in programs such as the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, Baltimore Children and Youth
  Fund, Safe Streets Baltimore, the Office of Employment and Development, or the Department
  of Health, shows our commitment to communities and the vision that all Baltimore
  residents deserve to thrive. Historically, the city government has spent far more
  on police than on public health, homeless services, youth services, and other vital
  agencies. This while the Baltimore Police Department disproportionately targets
  nonwhite residents--from traffic stops to the use of lethal force. \n\nIt’s time
  to staunch the expansion of the BPD's mandate into homeless services, schools, youth
  services, mental health, and other social services where an armed police force simply
  doesn't belong. It’s time to protect investments in human services, the social safety
  net, and racial and economic justice. I am writing to insist that the upcoming BBMR
  budget hearings for FY 2021 reflect the voices and needs of Baltimore’s citizens.
  I am asking that city officials give intense care, attention and effort towards
  sustainable, long-term change.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\""
