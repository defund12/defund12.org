  Dear Mayor Mitchell and Tempe City Council,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of Tempe, AZ. I am writing today to urge you to reduce funding for and limit the reach of the police in Tempe.

  I implore you to take action on the following:

  * Prioritize spending on community health, education, and affordable housing
  * Reduce the size of the police force
  * Suspend the use of paid administrative leave for police officers under investigation
  * Withhold pensions and donâ€™t rehire police officers involved in excessive force
  * Require police officers to be liable for misconduct settlements
  * Withdraw participation in police militarization programs

  People are marching in the streets because they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to please listen to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action to address their concerns.

  Thank you for your time,
  [NAME]
