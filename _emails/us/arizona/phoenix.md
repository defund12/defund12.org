subject: Reallocate police funds for social equity
body: "Dear Phoenix Mayor and Council members,\n\nMy name is [NAME] and I live in
  [DISTRICT OR CITY]. I am writing to you as a constituent who is disturbed by the
  injustices and brutality carried out by police forces across the country, and particularly
  in the Phoenix PD. \n\nIn February, the council approved a community review board
  and Office of Accountability and Transparency. They were given the power to:\n\n-
  Investigate and provide independent reports on police use-of-force incidents and
  citizen complaints\n\n- Make disciplinary recommendations for individual officers
  to the Police chief\n\n- Recommend policy changes based on research and community
  feedback\n\nWhen the council approved the plan, it anticipated it would cost about
  $3 million, but in Wednesday’s 2020-21 budget decision it only received $400,000.
  In 2019, The Phoenix PD received $721 million from the City of Phoenix. The current
  City Manager recommendation is $741 million, a $20 million increase, yet they can’t
  provide $3 million to OAT. \n\nEnding police brutality should be a budget priority.
  Justice should be a budget priority. Health and safety--which are proven to be better
  promoted through social programs and education than policing--should be a priority.
  I demand that you, as a representative of your Phoenix constituents, fully fund
  OAT, and redirect a meaningful portion of the Phoenix PD budget to social services,
  cultural programs, and education, which are backbones of any healthy community.
  Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[ADDRESS]\n[EMAIL]\n[PHONE NUMBER]"
