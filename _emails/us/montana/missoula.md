subject: Missoula demands a budget for justice
body: "To the Missoula City Council,\n\nMy name is \\[YOUR NAME\\] and I am a resident
  of \\[YOUR WARD\\]. I am writing to demand that the City Council adopts a budget
  that prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nMany
  Montanans may be tempted to think the unique nature of such a vast, yet sparsely-populated
  state minimizes the likelihood of police brutality in our small city communities.
  However, as reported by the Billings Gazette last year, Montana ranked ninth in
  killings by police per capita. In 2017, the Great Falls Tribune reported Montana
  police killings reached a total higher than the previous six years. These figures
  are alarming, but don’t tell the full story. Under Montana Code § 2-6-102 and Article
  II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution, police disciplinary records are exempt
  from disclosure if there is an \"individual privacy interest that clearly exceeds
  the merits of public disclosure.\" Montana police forces operate within a culture
  of impunity, and as the members of the communities they are supposed to be protecting,
  we can’t even begin to grasp the scope of their violence.\n\nWe are in the midst
  of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. Empty gestures and
  suggestions of “reform” are inadequate and unacceptable. I am demanding that real
  change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.\n\nSupport for communities
  in need is necessary now, more than ever. I am demanding that the City Council meaningfully
  defund the Missoula Police Department. I join the calls of those across the country
  to defund the police. I am demanding a budget that adequately and effectively meets
  the needs of at-risk Missoula residents during this trying and uncertain time. I
  am demanding a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowering
  the police forces that tear them apart.\n\nAs the City Council, the budget proposal
  is in your hands. It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you
  to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund the social
  programs proven to be more effective than policing at promoting community safety
  and equity. Have the courage to be a leader of the change this city, state, and
  country desperately needs.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\\[YOUR NAME\\] \n\\[YOUR
  ADDRESS\\] \n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\] \n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]"
