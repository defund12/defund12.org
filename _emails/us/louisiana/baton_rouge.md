body: "To Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome and the Baton Rouge City Council:\n\nMy
  name is [INSERT NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am writing to
  demand that the Baton Rouge City Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community
  wellbeing, and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nReferencing the most recent
  city budget, a staggering $93,530,380 has been allocated for the Baton Rouge police
  department. Relatedly, Louisiana has the highest incarceration rate in the nation,
  which disproportionately affects black citizens (e.g., over 60% of incarcerated
  individuals in LA were black according to the 2010 U.S. census). Baton Rouge’s state
  offices, capitol building, and even LSU’s campus all utilize prison labor, where
  prisoners earn between $0.00 to 0.70 cents per hour for their labor; this is state
  sanctioned, modern-day slavery.\n\nSignificantly less funds are allocated for vital
  community programs including workforce innovations, job training, and employment
  support programs under the Department of Human Development and Services (e.g., $736,520)
  and social services assistance, economic assistance, and housing assistance provided
  by the Office of Community Development (i.e., $8,299,510) for example.\n\nBaton
  Rouge is a city with high levels of poverty (i.e., 25.2% of Baton Rouge residents,
  over half of which are black, are living in poverty compared to the national average
  of 11.8% according to the U.S. census) and I am demanding that we re-allocate funds
  to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community and
  to address economic disparities. These programs include community-based mental health
  services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more.
  I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Baton Rouge residents.\n\nHistory
  has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways
  that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community,
  and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city. I strongly urge you
  to remove funding from police departments and reallocate it to social services that
  make a meaningful difference for the citizens of Baton Rouge.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR PHONE] \n[YOUR EMAIL]"
