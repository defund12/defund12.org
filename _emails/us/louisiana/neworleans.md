  Dear Mayor Cantrell and City Council Members,

  My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am a New Orleans resident writing to urge you to defund the New Orleans Police Department.

  I am contacting you to demand a significant reduction to the $194 million that is currently allocated to public safety in the upcoming fiscal budget of 2021 and for a formal review of the New Orleans Police Department Union Contract from an independent party that has no affiliation with NOPD. The police funds make up roughly 20% of the budget, while other important public services do not receive even half as much funding. By reducing police funding and reducing incarceration rates, those funds can be reallocated to housing, education or sanitation, among other needs. That way we can focus on building our community efforts and local organizations, while preventing future police brutality and violence.

  As New Orleans residents, we therefore demand that you take immediate action towards the following ends:
  * Reduce NOPDâ€™s allocation from the General Fund
  * Discontinue use of General Fund dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence
  * Invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe.
  * New Orleans can not wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to Defund NOPD.

  Thank you for your time,
