subject: Reallocate Funding From the Erie Police Department
body: |-
  Dear Erie Mayor's Office, City Council Members and other City Officials,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] from [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. More than a third of Erie's overall budget goes to funding the Erie PD. This is unacceptable. I urge you towards a reallocation of the Erie expense budget, away from Erie PD and towards social services and educational services.

  Sincerely,
  [YOUR NAME]
  [YOUR ADDRESS]
  [YOUR EMAIL]
