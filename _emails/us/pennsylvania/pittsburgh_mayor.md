  "Dear Mayor Peduto,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD/BOROUGH/CITY]\n\nFrom
  reports of protesters being attacked around the city to the killing of Antwon Rose
  in East Pittsburgh - the police have shown that they are not doing their jobs to
  serve and protect all citizens of this city.\n\nIn 2020 the Bureau of Police’s budget
  INCREASED by over $10 million dollars. The first goal listed on the budget is to
  improve “boots on the ground” field operations. This is not a budget dedicated to
  keeping citizens safe and healthy.\n\nI demand that budgeting funds are moved from
  the Bureau of Police (~18.8% of Pittsburgh’s Operating Budget) towards programs
  that support housing, jobs, education, and improve quality of life in our community
  and for Black Pittsburghers.\n\nHere are some departments from the Operations and
  Capital budgets that could use this financial support:\n\nOffice of Equity - only
  allocated $1,758,022 (~0.29% of 2020 Operating Budget)\nNeighborhood and Community
  Development - only allocated $7,502,080 (~6.8% of 2020 Capital Budget)\nCommunity
  Based Organizations - only allocated $500,000 (~0.45% of 2020 Capital Budget)\nNeighborhood
  Employment Centers - only allocated $150,000 (~0.14% of Capital Budget)\nPittsburgh
  Employment Program - only allocated $150,000 (~0.14% of Capital Budget)\nFair Housing
  - only allocated $100,000 (~0.09% of Capital Budget)\n\nThe lack of community support
  is evident in the Pittsburgh 2020 budget. No amount of tweets, photo-ops, bare minimum
  training, or grand promises will make up for the fact that the city is not monetarily
  invested in supporting its people. Move to make real change in the city of Pittsburgh
  by divesting from the Bureau of Police and funneling money back into supporting
  the community.\n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL] \n[YOUR
  PHONE NUMBER]"
