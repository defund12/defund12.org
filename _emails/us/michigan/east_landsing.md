  Hello,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of East Lansing. I am writing to demand that funding is reallocated from the ELPD to social and public programs in our community. It is an outrage that 32% of city funding goes towards the Police Department while public works and cultural investment is less than 10% of the city budget. The ELPD has seen a number of high profile abuse and violence claims recently and the budget should reflect that poor performance.

  I write to demand that the City Council defund the East Lansing Police Department. I join the calls of those across the country to defund the police. I am demanding a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of impacted East Lansing residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. A budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers police should be your number one priority.

  It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the proposed East Lansing city budget for FY2021. Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,
