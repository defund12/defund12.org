  Dear Broome County Legislature,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD/DISTRICT]. I am asking the County Legislature to begin meaningfully defunding the Broome County Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Broome County residents. Much scholarship shows that a living wage, access to health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at promoting community safety than policing and prisons. As such, I demand a meaningful reallocation of police department funds towards healthcare and social programs.

  Sincerely,
  [YOUR NAME]
  [YOUR ADDRESS]
