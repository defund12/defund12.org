body: "To the Rochester City Council and Mayor Lovely Warren,\n\nMy name is [YOUR
  NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am imploring you to meaningfully
  restrict the Rochester Police Department’s $95.87 million dollar budget immediately.
  These funds would be better allocated towards services proven to more effectively
  promote a safe and equitable community, such as community mental health services,
  substance abuse treatment services, education, affordable housing programs, and
  more.\n\nIn the proposed 2020-2021 budget, it was mentioned that many residents
  are dissatisfied with the Rochester City School District and prioritize the cultivation
  of healthy schools and recreational services for Rochester children. Recreational
  and youth services are budgeted at just over $12.4 million. The child poverty level
  in Rochester is one of the highest in the nation, with a rate of 52 percent between
  2013 and 2017. The police are allocated over 672% more funds than youth services
  in the proposed 2020-2021 budget. Additionally, while the city spends $119.1 million
  in aid to the Rochester City School District, this accounts for only 12.8% of the
  RCSD budget. If even part of the police budget were allocated to the RCSD, imagine
  the kind of change that the city could see in its education system.\n\nMuch scholarship
  shows that a living wage, access to health services and treatment, educational opportunity,
  and stable housing are far more successful at promoting community safety than policing
  and prisons. Police “reform” is not enough. As such, I demand a meaningful reallocation
  of police department funds towards education, healthcare, and social programs.\n\nSincerely,
  \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
