subject: Buffalo Police Department Budget Reform and Action Plan
body: "To the Buffalo Common Council and Office of Mayor Byron Brown,\n\nMy name is
  [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am imploring you
  to meaningfully restrict the Buffalo Police Department's $121.9 million dollar budget
  immediately. On June 5, Buffalo Police officers pushed a non-violent 75 year old
  man to the ground while he was exercising his first amendment rights. In case you
  have not seen the footage, it is linked below.\n\nI am calling for these officers
  to be charged and removed from service, effective immediately. I am calling for
  Mayor Brown and the Buffalo Common Council to have an emergency meeting regarding
  this matter. I am asking that an action plan for sustainable, long-term change is
  created and upheld.\n\nRecreational programming for the elderly is budgeted at $1M,
  while the net budget for youth programs is $401K. Buffalo has the nation's fourth
  worst poverty rate for children, with almost one half of children in Buffalo living
  in poverty. The police were allocated 30,000% more funding than our city’s youth
  in the 2019-20 city budget.\n\nIn one of this country’s poorest cities, the majority
  of taxpayer dollars are funding a police department that has had 15 cases of alleged
  police brutality or excessive force since 2006. Of those 15 victims, 13 of them,
  or 86%, were people of color. An outline of these cases are included as a post-script
  to this email, alongside my sources.\n\nThis is unacceptable, and I am calling on
  the Buffalo Common Council, Buffalo Police Commissioner, and Mayor Byron Brown to
  reduce the Buffalo Police department's budget, and re-allocate police funding to
  invest in our community--as a start. Improving our educational system, local opportunities
  for economic growth, and programs that fight hunger and housing are proven to be
  more effective than police presence in improving community safety and wellness.
  \n\nHow will you show up for a city in desperate need of help? Spending $121.9 million
  dollars on the Buffalo Police is not the solution.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR
  ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n\nPS: Their names are Quentin
  Suttles. Wilson Morales. A former Erie County Sheriff's Deputy assaulted someone
  at a tailgate party and was found guilty of falsifying records. Pito Rivera. Devin
  Ford. Troy Hodge. Marcus Neal. Shaun Porter was brutally beaten while an inmate
  in handcuffs while officers Joshua Craig and Anthony D'Agostino watched and laughed.
  Shaun was given a $300,000 settlement by you, the Common Council. Four Black teenagers
  were assaulted by Gregory Kwaiatkowski and called \"savage dogs.\" Kwaiatowski also
  choked David N. Mack in 2006. Kwaiatkowski was sentenced to four months in prison
  in 2018 for pleading guilty in December 2016 to a civil rights violation dating
  back to 2009. Timothy Stanton, Jr. Jose Hernandez-Rossy (at a traffic stop). Wardel
  \"Meech\" Davis, who died in police custody. National Air Guardsman William Sager
  who was handcuffed while unconscious and later died. John T. Willet, a Black man,
  was kicked and slapped while handcuffed on the ground by Buffalo Police officer
  John Cirulli, who was sentenced to a year of probation. Cirulli resigned and pleaded
  guilty to two federal misdemeanor civil rights violations earlier in 2014.\n\nSources
