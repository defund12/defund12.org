subject: Reallocate police budget to social services
body: "Dear Westchester County Legislature,\n\nMy name is [NAME] and I am a resident
  of [TOWN]. I am asking you to reallocate money away from the Westchester County
  Police Department. According to a 2018 report, Black people are the subjects of
  42% of all arrests in Westchester despite making up only 14% of our population (https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/comparison-population-arrests-prison-demographics/2018%20Population%20Arrests%20Prison%20by%20Race.pdf).
  Furthermore, Black people convicted of a crime in Westchester are sentenced to jail
  time at a higher rate than those of any other race, across all types of crime charges
  (https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/dispositions-adult-arrest-demographics/2018/Westchester.pdf).
  \n\nCounty police is disproportionately overfunded in the 2020 county budget, but
  research shows that a living wage, access to health services and treatment, educational
  opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at promoting community safety
  than policing and prisons. As such, I demand a meaningful reallocation of police
  department funds towards healthcare and social programs.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR
  NAME]\n\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
