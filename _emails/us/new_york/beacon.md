body: "Dear Beacon City Council and Mayor,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a Beacon
  resident and writing to urge you to defund the Beacon Police Department.\n\nThe
  Beacon Police department currently has a budget of $5.5 Million. That has increased
  $700,000 in the past 6 years while other services have been cut or kept the same.
  That's about 25% of our total budget for a town of roughly 15K people, taking away
  desperately needed resources from essential city programs and services.\n\nI demand
  that the Mayor and City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Beacon Police Department
  and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe
  and equitable community: our public schools and after-school programs, a recreation
  center, emergency health center, community-based mental health services, affordable
  housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of
  Beacon residents.\n\nHistory has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must
  take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and
  in fact actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of
  police in our city.\n\nThank you for your time, \n[YOUR NAME] \n[YOUR ADDRESS] \n[YOUR
  EMAIL] \n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
