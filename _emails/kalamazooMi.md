subject: Regarding the funding of KDPS
body: "Hello, \n\nI am a constituent living in Kalamazoo County and I am writing to
  you regarding recent police excessive force at the protests against police brutality
  as well as Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety's place in our budgets. The police's
  behavior at the peaceful protests in early June were been aggressive, unnecessary,
  and intentionally provocative. It's clear from all footage that the only people
  in danger were the protesters, surprised by police cruisers speeding towards them,
  the National Guard boxing them in, and tear gas, a tactic not allowed in war but
  evidently perfectly fine for a medium size city's oversized police. \n\nThis kind
  of behavior is a long standing pattern with KDPS, a police force with multiple questionable
  in custody deaths, excessive force accusations, a documented habit of pulling over
  predominantly black drivers and enough unnecessary lethal equipment to outfit a
  small army. The time for hiding behind canned apologies, promises of diversity training
  and \"community policing\" is over. It's time to reduce police spending and reallocate
  those funds to programs that have real tangible benefits, especially to communities
  harmed by decades of over-policing and discrimination. \n\nKalamazoo Public School
  officials have been sounding the alarm that due to COVID-19 tax shortfalls, they
  could be facing unprecedented cuts to per pupil funding. Yet KDPS is accepting applications
  for new officers despite already having more employees than any other city department.
  Public health workers in Kalamazoo have had to sew their own face masks to serve
  consumers safely during the pandemic. Yet KDPS has a stockpile of face shields they
  are using for public intimidation, not protection. Kalamazoo Public Safety takes
  up 48% of the entire general fund budget for 2020. Other public services account
  for a paltry 8% and parks and recreation a depressing 4% of budget. That is outrageous
  and needs to change. Kalamazoo needs dollars for services that actually improve
  and lift up our community. Dollars for education, for food assistance, for housing,
  for people. Not policing.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
