  Hi, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am asking to redirect money away from the Atlanta PD and into the following social services: [LIST - Community Development, COVID Relief, Education, Parks & Recreation]. I request that an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect in order to deny the mayor's proposed budget and reallocate these funds to resources the citizens can benefit from.

  Thank you for your time,
