subject: Please decrease Chapel Hill Police Department’s budget
body: |
  Dear Mayor Hemminger and Council members,

  I write today to urge you to amend the recommended budget for FY 2020-21. In light of the continued devaluation of Black life in this country, I am disappointed to see that my town plans to increase the police budget in the coming year.

  We have reached a turning point, here in Chapel Hill and around the country. We may choose to divert funds from an increasingly militarized police force and invest in community education, health, and employment. Or we may increase already sizable budgets and escalate the terror Black Americans face on our streets. I hope you all will choose the former.

  Please do not increase the police budget in FY2020-21.

  Thank you,
