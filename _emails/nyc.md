subject: Commit to Vote No on the Mayor's Budget / Defund the NYPD
body: "Dear New York City Council Members, \n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident
  of [BOROUGH]. Last April, NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio proposed major budget cuts for
  the Fiscal Year 2021, especially to education and youth programs, while refusing
  to slash the NYPD budget by any significant margin. \n\nI am emailing today to demand
  that you vote no on the Mayor's FY21 proposed budget. Furthermore, I urge you to
  pressure the office of the mayor towards an ethical and equal reallocation of the
  NYC expense budget, away from NYPD and towards social services and education programs,
  effective at the beginning of FY21, July 1, 2020. \n\nGovernor Cuomo has doubled
  the presence of the NYPD on New York City streets. I am asking that city officials
  lobby the same amount of attention and effort towards finding sustainable, longterm
  change. \n\nThank you, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE
  NUMBER]\n"
