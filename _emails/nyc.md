subject: Commit to Vote No on the Mayor's Budget / Defund the NYPD
body: "Dear New York City Council Members, \n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident
  of [BOROUGH]. Last April, NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio proposed major budget cuts for
  the Fiscal Year 2021, especially to education and youth programs, while refusing
  to slash the NYPD budget by any significant margin. \n\nI am emailing today to demand
  that you vote no on the Mayor's FY21 proposed budget. Furthermore, I urge you ONLY
  to vote for a budget that includes AT LEAST $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD with
  equal reallocation towards social services and education programs, effective at
  the beginning of FY21, July 1, 2020. \n\nGovernor Cuomo has doubled the presence
  of the NYPD on New York City streets. I am asking that city officials lobby the
  same amount of attention and effort towards finding sustainable, longterm change.
  \n\nThank you, \n[YOUR NAME] \n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
