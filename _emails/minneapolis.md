subject: Defund the Minneapolis Police Department
body: "Dear Mayor Frey and City Council Members,\n\nMy name is \\[YOUR NAME\\]. I
  am a resident of \\[YOUR CITY, STATE\\] and I am emailing today to demand the defunding
  of the Minneapolis Police Department and the funding of new, community-led and integrated
  health and safety strategies.\n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval over
  the systemic, racist violence which has been, to this point, overseen by the Minneapolis
  City Council. George Floyd was murdered during this oversight. Beloved Minneapolis
  institutions were burned and destroyed in the aftermath. People have been left without
  the resources they need. Jobs and livelihoods will take a long time to recover.
  And most of all, Black citizens of Minneapolis continue in this moment to live in
  a city that is currently upholding the Minneapolis Police Department which has brutalized
  and taken too many Black lives. Therefore, we will no longer accept empty gestures
  and suggestions of reform. \n\nWe need to defund the Minneapolis Police Department.
  We need a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of Minneapolis
  residents during the pandemic and well past it; and we need a budget that supports
  communities and supports their well-being. \n\nI am urging you and the Minneapolis
  City Council to adopt a budget that defunds the police and funds non-violent, community-led,
  health and safety strategies.\n\nSincerely,\\\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR
  EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]"
