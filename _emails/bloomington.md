subject: Decrease funding for police in the 2021 budget
body: "Dear City Councilors,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I'm a resident of [YOUR
  CITY/DISTRICT]. I am writing about the fiscal year 2021 budget for the City of Bloomington.
  \n\nMayor Hamilton states that he wants to make Bloomington more \"equitable\" and
  to increase the \"appeal and attractiveness of our community [...] to a wide diversity
  of people throughout the city.\" \n\nDespite those claims, the 2020 budget allocated
  $12 million, or 26% of the total budget, to the Bloomington Police department, while
  community services received less than $800,000, or 1.7% of the total budget.\n\nI
  am asking that the Bloomington City Council make a more overt and visible commitment
  to the city's Black and Brown communities to combat an over-investment in their
  criminalization and surveillance. I therefore demand that the Council find ways
  to redirect money away from the BPD's overinflated budget. I urge you to pressure
  the mayor for an ethical and equal reallocation of the city's expenditures, away
  from the BPD, and towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and
  class inequality.\n\nNow especially, the City Council can take a supportive stand
  on racial and social justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in
  the community instead-starting with housing, transportation, education, community
  centers, and community-led organizations and projects.\n\nCan I count on you to
  consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social services programs?\n\nThank
  you,\n\n[YOUR NAME] \n\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
