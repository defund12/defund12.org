subject: Decrease funding for police in the 2021 budget
body: "Dear City Councilors,\n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I’m a resident of [YOUR CITY/DISTRICT]. 
I am writing about the fiscal year 2021 budget for the City of Bloomington. \n\nMayor Hamilton states 
that he wants to make Bloomington more “equitable” and to increase the “appeal and attractiveness of 
our community […] to a wide diversity of people throughout the city.” \n\nDespite those claims, the 
2020 budget allocated $12 million, or 26% of the total budget, to the Bloomington Police department, 
while community services received less than $800,000, or 1.7% of the total budget.\n\nI am asking that 
the Bloomington City Council make a more overt and visible commitment to the city’s Black and Brown 
communities to combat an over-investment in their criminalization and surveillance. I therefore demand 
that the Council find ways to redirect money away from the BPD’s overinflated budget. I urge you to 
pressure the mayor for an ethical and equal reallocation of the city’s expenditures, away from the BPD, 
and towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and class inequality.\n\nNow especially, 
the City Council can take a supportive stand on racial and social justice by significantly defunding 
policing and investing in the community instead—starting with housing, transportation, education, 
community centers, and community-led organizations and projects.\n\nCan I count on you to consider 
an alternative budget that puts a focus on social services programs?\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]
\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
