  I am a resident of Reno. I am writing to demand that Mayor Hillary Schieve and City Council to do everything in their power to adopt a budget that prioritizes our community well being and redirects funding away from the police in the next budget evaluation period.

  We have seen mounting evidence that police departments are racist and ineffective institutions that put citizens at risk of injury and death, yet the police budget accounts for 36% of our general fund.

  I ask that you redirect the majority of the $41.9M allotted for crime prevention towards community programs that provide citizens with basic human needs like affordable healthcare and housing. With over 20% of our residents currently unemployed, we need funding to address the needs of people hurting from the effects of COVID 19, people experiencing homelessness, and the marginalized communities in our city.

  I also STRONGLY URGE the City Council to enact legislation instituting a community elected Civilian Police Accountability Council with the following powers; ability to review and change disciplinary actions, review all violent interactions, and impose discipline including firing.

  Our community is in pain along with the nation. We desperately need to change what our community prioritizes.

  Thank you for your time,
