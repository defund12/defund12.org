subject: Commit to reallocate for social equity
body: "Dear Nassau County Legislature, \n\nHi, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident
  of [TOWN]. I am asking you to reallocate money away from the Nassau County PD, which
  disproportionately targets black residents. From traffic stops, to arrests, to the
  use of lethal force, Nassau PD targets nonwhite residents at a rate far exceeding
  their share of the population. Much scholarship shows that a living wage, access
  to health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are
  far more successful at promoting community safety than policing and prisons. As
  such, I demand a meaningful reallocation of PD funds towards healthcare and social
  programs. \n\nSincerely, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE
  NUMBER]\n"
