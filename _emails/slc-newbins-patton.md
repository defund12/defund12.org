  Dear Salt Lake City Leadership,
My name is {_____}. With a heavy heart, I implore you to reconsider the prosecution of  Mr. Patton and Mr. Newbins. Politics have no place in the justice system, and the informal charges brought forth against these two men are exclusively for political gain. 

I urge you to consider the Black Lives Matter movement, and exercise justice with a tender hand. Understanding the significance of this global event, and the comparative peacefulness of Salt Lake City. 

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 
  [YOUR NAME]
