subject: I Oppose Budget Ordinace BL2020-286
body: |
    "To whom it may concern,

    My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a Baltimore resident. In the midst of this pandemic and public outcry against police brutality, it feels more inappropriate than ever to propose increases to the BPD budget from $530 Million to $545 million. I urge you to ethically reallocate the Baltimore City Expense Budget, divesting interest in the BPD, and investing social services and education programs, effective at the beginning of FY 2021. Investment in programs such as the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, Baltimore Children and Youth Fund, Safe Streets Baltimore, the Office of Employment and Development, or the Department of Health, shows our commitment to communities and the vision that all Baltimore residents deserve to thrive. Historically, the city government has spent far more on police than on public health, homeless services, youth services, and other vital agencies. It’s time to defund the BPD’s harmful expansion into homeless services, schools, youth services, mental health, and other social services where police don’t belong. It’s time to protect investments in human services, the social safety net, and racial and economic justice. I am writing to insist that the upcoming BBMR budget hearings for FY 2021 reflect the voices and needs of Baltimore’s citizens. I am asking that city officials lobby intense care, attention and effort towards finding sustainable, longterm change.

    Thank you,
