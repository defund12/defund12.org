subject: Fully Fund The OAT and Civil Review Board And Redirect Additional PHX PD
  Funds
body: "My name is [NAME] and I live in [DISTRICT OR CITY]. I am writing to you as
  a constituent who is disturbed by the injustices and brutality carried out by police
  forces across the country, and particularly in the Phoenix PD. In February, the
  council approved a community review board and Office of Accountability and Transparency.
  They were given the power to: \n -investigate and provide independent reports on
  police use-of-force incidents and citizen complaints \n -make disciplinary recommendations
  for individual officers to the Police chief \n -recommend policy changes based on
  research and community feedback \n When the council approved the plan, it anticipated
  it would cost about $3 million, but in Wednesday’s 2020-21 budget decision it only
  received $400,000. In 2019, The Phoenix PD received $721 million from the City of
  Phoenix. The current City Manager recommendation is $741 million, a $20 million
  increase, yet they can’t provide $3 million to OAT. Ending police brutality should
  be a budget priority. Justice should be a budget priority. Without oversight, there
  will be no consequences. I demand that you, as a representative of the Phoenix constituents,
  fully fund the $3 million for the OAT, and redirect the additional $20 million for
  the Phoenix PD to social services and cultural programs, which are backbones of
  any healthy community. Thank you. \n Sincerely, \n\n[NAME] \n\n[ADDRESS] \n\n[EMAIL]
  \n\n[PHONE NUMBER]"
