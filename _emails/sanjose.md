subject: Defund the Police Department
body: "Hello, \n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of San Jose. I am writing
  to demand that funding is reallocated from SJPD to social and public programming
  that takes place in our communities. It is an outrage that 44% of city funding goes
  towards the Police Department. The SJPD has seen a rise in overtime pay which, more
  often than not, is paid out to officers responsible for harassing the unhoused,
  and Black, Indigenous, people of color.\n\nWe demand that the City Council defund
  the SJPD. We join the calls of those across the country to #DefundThePolice. We
  demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk San Jose
  residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line.
  We demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowering police.\n\nIt
  is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise
  the San Jose city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund #CareNotCops. Public
  opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\"\n\n"
