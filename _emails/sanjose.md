subject: Defund the Police Department
body: "\"We demand reallocation of funding from SJPD to social and public programming
  that takes place in our communities, demand regulation ensure oversight board for
  public spending. It is an outrage that 44% of the city funding goes towards the
  Police Department. It has seen a rise in overtime pay which, more often than not,
  is paid out to officers responsible for harassing the unhoused, and Black, Indigenous,
  people of color.\n\nWe demand that the City Council defund the SJPD. We join the
  calls of those across the country to #DefundThePolice. We demand a budget that adequately
  and effectively meets the needs of at-risk San Jose residents during this trying
  and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget that supports
  community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.\n\nIt
  is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise
  the San Jose city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund #CareNotCops. Public
  opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS] \n[YOUR
