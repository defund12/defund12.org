subject: SPPS Must Terminate Relations with Police Department
body: "Dear Dr. Joe Gothard, Marny Xiong, and Saint Paul Public Schools Board Members,\n\nMy
  name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of [YOUR CITY, STATE]. I stand in solidarity
  with protesters across the country who are out in the streets in response to the
  horrific murders of George Floyd, a Black man, by the Minneapolis police, and are
  appalled by the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and
  countless others. More broadly, we call for an end to police terror and anti-Blackness.
  \n\nI recognize the importance of education. It is imperative that Black students
  are free from police violence and terror in their schools. That is not possible
  if the district continues its relationship with local police departments and private
  security companies. I urge Saint Paul Public Schools to follow the lead of Minneapolis
  Public Schools, and take action to divest from policing in the district.\n\nTo that
  end, I demand that SPPS immediately terminate all of their relations with police
  departments and private security companies. These policing institutions enact the
  same violence in our own communities as we have seen this week in Minneapolis, and
  through these relations our public schools support this violence and continue to
  uphold the white supremacy that is foundational to this country.\n\nI join students,
  teachers, parents and alumni around the country in our demand that schools remove
  police and security officers from SPPS. I call on SPPS to take the following actions
  â€“\n1. Break ties immediately with the police departments and private security companies
  in that contract with SPPS. Police, and their proxies, private security companies,
  have no place on elementary, middle and high school campuses.\n2. Redirect funds
  divested from policing to provide educational opportunities for communities impacted
  by police violence.\n3. Commit resources to support community-led alternatives to
  policing.\n4. Propose plans for ensuring the safety of Black and other marginalized
  students on campus from racial profiling by police and other security forces with
  input from members of the Black, indigenous and other communities of color themselves.
  \n5. Issue statements condemning these recent murders.\n\nAlthough the murder of
  George Floyd was the catalyst for these recent protests, it was not the sole cause.
  Black people have been subjected to centuries of state terror, and economic and
  social exclusion. The current protests reflect concerned members of society taking
  direct, collective action to demand an end to the abuse and violence directed against
  Black people. \n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
