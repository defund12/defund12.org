subject: We Demand Divestment from Police and an Investment in Black Communities
body: "Dear City Council Members, \n\nMy name is [NAME], and I am a resident of Austin,
  Texas. I am outraged at the excessive use of force that APD used against protesters
  this weekend. Using police brutality against people peacefully protesting police
  brutality is, at the very least, a bad look and, to be honest, is proof that these
  protests are necessary. A sixteen year old Chicano boy was shot while standing away
  from the main crowd of protestors, and a twenty year old Black man was shot in the
  head and remains in critical condition. A pregnant Black woman was shot in her stomach
  and back with \"non-lethal\" rounds by APD. The use of tear gas (prohibited for
  use in WARFARE by many international treaties) and rubber bullets (not meant to
  be shot point blank, but has been) against unarmed protesters is absolutely unacceptable.
  \n\nFollowing the murder of Mike Ramos and the recent city report that found a culture
  of misogyny and racism at APD, I am calling on you to seriously reduce city funding
  to APD and to implement immediate reform. There is no reason that over ⅓ of Austin’s
  budget should be allocated to the police. In the middle of a pandemic and a recession,
  we should be using our city's budget to fund affordable housing and public health
  rather than a violent police department that is, quite frankly, upholding policies
  and practices that allow white supremacy to take Black lives every single day. Thank
  you for your work to serve our city.\n\nSincerely,\nThe People of Austin, TX\n[NAME]\n[PHONE_NUMBER]\n[EMAIL]\n[ADDRESS]\n"
