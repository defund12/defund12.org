# Defund12.org Team Organization

## 1. User that submits issue

Anyone who would like to add an email for their locale creates issue in adherence to the [email guidelines](https://github.com/teddywilson/defund12.org/blob/gh-pages/EMAIL_TEMPLATE_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

## 2. Triage Team

A person on the triage team is the first to review newly created issues. Look over all issues with <kbd>new-request</kbd> label.

### Responsibilities

#### Check for duplicates
- Check if the issue is a duplicate of an existing request or existing template. In the Issues tab, search for the requested locale with `is:open is:closed [LOCALE]` to see if an open request or merged template already exists.

- If the request is a duplicate, add the <kbd>duplicate</kbd> label and close the issue with a link to the earlier request

#### Check for completion
- Check if issue has all required data
  - Does it meet basic data requirements?
    - Recipients (CC addresses)
    - Body text
  - If not, **close issue** and reply with the contents of the [email request template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defund12/defund12.org/gh-pages/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/EMAIL_REQUEST.md)<br>(copy the text between the `<!--` and `-->` characters)
  - If yes, add <kbd>content-ready-for-review</kbd> label and remove all other labels

## 3. Review, Editing, and Approval Team [Needs people!]

Ensure the email roughly adheres to [email guidelines](https://github.com/teddywilson/defund12.org/blob/gh-pages/EMAIL_TEMPLATE_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

### Responsibilities

- If body content is not salvageable, **close issue**.
- Is it _good enough_?
  - Does it have locale specific info?
  - Is the core statement in regards to defunding local police departments
  - Add <kbd>ready-for-pr</kbd> label and remove all other labels
- Even though the issue is _good enough_ and you added the <kbd>ready-for-pr</kbd> label, do you still think the email template needs work or editing?
  - Add <kbd>email-needs-work</kbd> label and leave comment on what the outstanding tasks are.

## 4. Email Addition Development Team

This team will pick up issues that have the <kbd>ready-for-pr</kbd> label. Issues should only be assigned to a developer for less 24 hrs to ensure emails get added to the site quickly.

### Responsibilities

- Assign issue to yourself so no other developer begins working on it
- Create a PR for the email issue
- Ensure the email markdown is correct and properly linted.
- Once PR is up, someone will review and merge!

### Conventions to follow

- Please refer to the emails [README](_emails/README.md) with more information about email template conventions.
